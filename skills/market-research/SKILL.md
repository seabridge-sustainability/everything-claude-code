<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Produce research that supports decisions, not research theater.

## When to Activate

- researching a market, category, company, investor, or technology trend
- building TAM/SAM/SOM estimates
- comparing competitors or adjacent products
- preparing investor dossiers before outreach
- pressure-testing a thesis before building, funding, or entering a market

## Research Standards

1. Every important claim needs a source.
2. Prefer recent data and call out stale data.
3. Include contrarian evidence and downside cases.
4. Translate findings into a decision, not just a summary.
5. Separate fact, inference, and recommendation clearly.

## Common Research Modes

### Investor / Fund Diligence
Collect:
- fund size, stage, and typical check size
- relevant portfolio companies
- public thesis and recent activity
- reasons the fund is or is not a fit
- any obvious red flags or mismatches

### Competitive Analysis
Collect:
- product reality, not marketing copy
- funding and investor history if public
- traction metrics if public
- distribution and pricing clues
- strengths, weaknesses, and positioning gaps

### Market Sizing
Use:
- top-down estimates from reports or public datasets
- bottom-up sanity checks from realistic customer acquisition assumptions
- explicit assumptions for every leap in logic

### Technology / Vendor Research
Collect:
- how it works
- trade-offs and adoption signals
- integration complexity
- lock-in, security, compliance, and operational risk

## Output Format

Default structure:
1. executive summary
2. key findings
3. implications
4. risks and caveats
5. recommendation
6. sources

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- all numbers are sourced or labeled as estimates
- old data is flagged
- the recommendation follows from the evidence
- risks and counterarguments are included
- the output makes a decision easier
