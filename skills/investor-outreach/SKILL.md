# Investor Outreach

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Write investor communication that is short, personalized, and easy to act on.

## When to Activate

- writing a cold email to an investor
- drafting a warm intro request
- sending follow-ups after a meeting or no response
- writing investor updates during a process
- tailoring outreach based on fund thesis or partner fit

## Core Rules

1. Personalize every outbound message.
2. Keep the ask low-friction.
3. Use proof, not adjectives.
4. Stay concise.
5. Never send generic copy that could go to any investor.

## Cold Email Structure

1. subject line: short and specific
2. opener: why this investor specifically
3. pitch: what the company does, why now, what proof matters
4. ask: one concrete next step
5. sign-off: name, role, one credibility anchor if needed

## Personalization Sources

Reference one or more of:
- relevant portfolio companies
- a public thesis, talk, post, or article
- a mutual connection
- a clear market or product fit with the investor's focus

If that context is missing, ask for it or state that the draft is a template awaiting personalization.

## Follow-Up Cadence

Default:
- day 0: initial outbound
- day 4-5: short follow-up with one new data point
- day 10-12: final follow-up with a clean close

Do not keep nudging after that unless the user wants a longer sequence.

## Warm Intro Requests

Make life easy for the connector:
- explain why the intro is a fit
- include a forwardable blurb
- keep the forwardable blurb under 100 words

## Post-Meeting Updates

Include:
- the specific thing discussed
- the answer or update promised
- one new proof point if available
- the next step

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- message is personalized
- the ask is explicit
- there is no fluff or begging language
- the proof point is concrete
- word count stays tight
