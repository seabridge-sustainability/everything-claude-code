# Safety Guard Ã¢â‚¬â€ Prevent Destructive Operations

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

## When to Use

- When working on production systems
- When agents are running autonomously (full-auto mode)
- When you want to restrict edits to a specific directory
- During sensitive operations (migrations, deploys, data changes)

## How It Works

Three modes of protection:

### Mode 1: Careful Mode

Intercepts destructive commands before execution and warns:

```
Watched patterns:
- rm -rf (especially /, ~, or project root)
- git push --force
- git reset --hard
- git checkout . (discard all changes)
- DROP TABLE / DROP DATABASE
- docker system prune
- kubectl delete
- chmod 777
- sudo rm
- npm publish (accidental publishes)
- Any command with --no-verify
```

When detected: shows what the command does, asks for confirmation, suggests safer alternative.

### Mode 2: Freeze Mode

Locks file edits to a specific directory tree:

```
/safety-guard freeze src/components/
```

Any Write/Edit outside `src/components/` is blocked with an explanation. Useful when you want an agent to focus on one area without touching unrelated code.

### Mode 3: Guard Mode (Careful + Freeze combined)

Both protections active. Maximum safety for autonomous agents.

```
/safety-guard guard --dir src/api/ --allow-read-all
```

Agents can read anything but only write to `src/api/`. Destructive commands are blocked everywhere.

### Unlock

```
/safety-guard off
```

## Implementation

Uses PreToolUse hooks to intercept Bash, Write, Edit, and MultiEdit tool calls. Checks the command/path against the active rules before allowing execution.

## Integration

- Enable by default for `codex -a never` sessions
- Pair with observability risk scoring in ECC 2.0
- Logs all blocked actions to `~/.claude/safety-guard.log`
