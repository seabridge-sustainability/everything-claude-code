  Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step construction plan for
  multi-session, multi-agent engineering projects. Each step has a
  self-contained context brief so a fresh agent can execute it cold.
  Includes adversarial review gate, dependency graph, parallel step
  detection, anti-pattern catalog, and plan mutation protocol.
  TRIGGER when: user requests a plan, blueprint, or roadmap for a
  complex multi-PR task, or describes work that needs multiple sessions.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: task is completable in a single PR or fewer
  than 3 tool calls, or user says "just do it".

# Blueprint Ã¢â‚¬â€ Construction Plan Generator

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.
<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_END -->


Turn a one-line objective into a step-by-step construction plan that any coding agent can execute cold.

## When to Use

- Breaking a large feature into multiple PRs with clear dependency order
- Planning a refactor or migration that spans multiple sessions
- Coordinating parallel workstreams across sub-agents
- Any task where context loss between sessions would cause rework

**Do not use** for tasks completable in a single PR, fewer than 3 tool calls, or when the user says "just do it."

## How It Works

Blueprint runs a 5-phase pipeline:

1. **Research** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Pre-flight checks (git, gh auth, remote, default branch), then reads project structure, existing plans, and memory files to gather context.
2. **Design** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Breaks the objective into one-PR-sized steps (3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12 typical). Assigns dependency edges, parallel/serial ordering, model tier (strongest vs default), and rollback strategy per step.
3. **Draft** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Writes a self-contained Markdown plan file to `plans/`. Every step includes a context brief, task list, verification commands, and exit criteria Ã¢â‚¬â€ so a fresh agent can execute any step without reading prior steps.
4. **Review** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Delegates adversarial review to a strongest-model sub-agent (e.g., Opus) against a checklist and anti-pattern catalog. Fixes all critical findings before finalizing.
5. **Register** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Saves the plan, updates memory index, and presents the step count and parallelism summary to the user.

Blueprint detects git/gh availability automatically. With git + GitHub CLI, it generates full branch/PR/CI workflow plans. Without them, it switches to direct mode (edit-in-place, no branches).

## Examples

### Basic usage

```
/blueprint myapp "migrate database to PostgreSQL"
```

Produces `plans/myapp-migrate-database-to-postgresql.md` with steps like:
- Step 1: Add PostgreSQL driver and connection config
- Step 2: Create migration scripts for each table
- Step 3: Update repository layer to use new driver
- Step 4: Add integration tests against PostgreSQL
- Step 5: Remove old database code and config

### Multi-agent project

```
/blueprint chatbot "extract LLM providers into a plugin system"
```

Produces a plan with parallel steps where possible (e.g., "implement Anthropic plugin" and "implement OpenAI plugin" run in parallel after the plugin interface step is done), model tier assignments (strongest for the interface design step, default for implementation), and invariants verified after every step (e.g., "all existing tests pass", "no provider imports in core").

## Key Features

- **Cold-start execution** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Every step includes a self-contained context brief. No prior context needed.
- **Adversarial review gate** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Every plan is reviewed by a strongest-model sub-agent against a checklist covering completeness, dependency correctness, and anti-pattern detection.
- **Branch/PR/CI workflow** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Built into every step. Degrades gracefully to direct mode when git/gh is absent.
- **Parallel step detection** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Dependency graph identifies steps with no shared files or output dependencies.
- **Plan mutation protocol** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Steps can be split, inserted, skipped, reordered, or abandoned with formal protocols and audit trail.
- **Zero runtime risk** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Pure Markdown skill. The entire repository contains only `.md` files Ã¢â‚¬â€ no hooks, no shell scripts, no executable code, no `package.json`, no build step. Nothing runs on install or invocation beyond Claude Code's native Markdown skill loader.

## Installation

This skill ships with Everything Claude Code. No separate installation is needed when ECC is installed.

### Full ECC install

If you are working from the ECC repository checkout, verify the skill is present with:

```bash
test -f skills/blueprint/SKILL.md
```

To update later, review the ECC diff before updating:

```bash
cd /path/to/everything-claude-code
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main       # review new commits before updating
git checkout <reviewed-full-sha>          # pin to a specific reviewed commit
```

### Vendored standalone install

If you are vendoring only this skill outside the full ECC install, copy the reviewed file from the ECC repository into `~/.claude/skills/blueprint/SKILL.md`. Vendored copies do not have a git remote, so update them by re-copying the file from a reviewed ECC commit rather than running `git pull`.

## Requirements

- Claude Code (for `/blueprint` slash command)
- Git + GitHub CLI (optional Ã¢â‚¬â€ enables full branch/PR/CI workflow; Blueprint detects absence and auto-switches to direct mode)

## Source

Inspired by antbotlab/blueprint Ã¢â‚¬â€ upstream project and reference design.
