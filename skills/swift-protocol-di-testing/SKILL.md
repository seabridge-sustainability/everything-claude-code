# Swift Protocol-Based Dependency Injection for Testing

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action. Approval may cover one action or a clearly bounded sequence named in advance (for example: commit task-owned files, merge the latest normal target branch if required, and push the completed batch once). Do not ask again for steps already included in that approval. Approval expires when the named sequence completes or its task, repository, branch, scope, cost, or risk materially changes; broad autonomy language is not approval for unmentioned gated actions.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. Removing files created during the task and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases are fine. Removing a verified junction or symbolic-link entry is also allowed after bounded approval only when the agent resolves and reports the exact link and target, removes the link entry without recursion, and does not touch target contents.
2. **Ask first:** unless already granted above, commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval. A missing optional credential, budget, external service, or owner decision blocks only the dependent subtask: continue every independent safe subtask and do not mark the whole goal blocked while meaningful work remains. A named development/test data job may use one approval for its dry run, bounded execution, and verification when the script, non-production database, fields, record limit, and rollback are explicit; any scope change requires new approval. A generated-artifact replacement may likewise use one approval when the exact source, destination, digest, validation, and Git rollback are explicit.
7. **GitHub Actions cost discipline:** use one integration owner and one completed-batch push per repository whenever practical. Subagents never push or dispatch, rerun, or cancel workflows. Run targeted local checks first; do not push merely to test CI. Before pushing, collect all ready task-owned work, fetch and integrate the current remote tip once, and inspect active or queued runs. Avoid overlapping a relevant run unless the change is urgent. If CI fails, diagnose the full failure set and batch locally verified fixes into at most one corrective push. Manual workflow dispatches, reruns, deploys, and other cost-incurring actions remain separately gated unless explicitly included in the current approval.
8. **Behavioral-eval cost ceiling:** live model evals still require explicit current-session approval and the harness approval gate. If that approval names the eval batch but omits a number, use a maximum total ceiling of USD 5 for one batch (never per call), keep the hard nine-call limit, and require the soft-budget acknowledgement for harnesses without provider-enforced caps. A lower user-supplied ceiling wins. Never treat missing cost telemetry as proof of zero cost, and never start a second batch without new approval.

Patterns for making Swift code testable by abstracting external dependencies (file system, network, iCloud) behind small, focused protocols. Enables deterministic tests without I/O.

## When to Activate

- Writing Swift code that accesses file system, network, or external APIs
- Need to test error handling paths without triggering real failures
- Building modules that work across environments (app, test, SwiftUI preview)
- Designing testable architecture with Swift concurrency (actors, Sendable)

## Core Pattern

### 1. Define Small, Focused Protocols

Each protocol handles exactly one external concern.

```swift
// File system access
public protocol FileSystemProviding: Sendable {
    func containerURL(for purpose: Purpose) -> URL?
}

// File read/write operations
public protocol FileAccessorProviding: Sendable {
    func read(from url: URL) throws -> Data
    func write(_ data: Data, to url: URL) throws
    func fileExists(at url: URL) -> Bool
}

// Bookmark storage (e.g., for sandboxed apps)
public protocol BookmarkStorageProviding: Sendable {
    func saveBookmark(_ data: Data, for key: String) throws
    func loadBookmark(for key: String) throws -> Data?
}
```

### 2. Create Default (Production) Implementations

```swift
public struct DefaultFileSystemProvider: FileSystemProviding {
    public init() {}

    public func containerURL(for purpose: Purpose) -> URL? {
        FileManager.default.url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier: nil)
    }
}

public struct DefaultFileAccessor: FileAccessorProviding {
    public init() {}

    public func read(from url: URL) throws -> Data {
        try Data(contentsOf: url)
    }

    public func write(_ data: Data, to url: URL) throws {
        try data.write(to: url, options: .atomic)
    }

    public func fileExists(at url: URL) -> Bool {
        FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: url.path)
    }
}
```

### 3. Create Mock Implementations for Testing

```swift
public final class MockFileAccessor: FileAccessorProviding, @unchecked Sendable {
    public var files: [URL: Data] = [:]
    public var readError: Error?
    public var writeError: Error?

    public init() {}

    public func read(from url: URL) throws -> Data {
        if let error = readError { throw error }
        guard let data = files[url] else {
            throw CocoaError(.fileReadNoSuchFile)
        }
        return data
    }

    public func write(_ data: Data, to url: URL) throws {
        if let error = writeError { throw error }
        files[url] = data
    }

    public func fileExists(at url: URL) -> Bool {
        files[url] != nil
    }
}
```

### 4. Inject Dependencies with Default Parameters

Production code uses defaults; tests inject mocks.

```swift
public actor SyncManager {
    private let fileSystem: FileSystemProviding
    private let fileAccessor: FileAccessorProviding

    public init(
        fileSystem: FileSystemProviding = DefaultFileSystemProvider(),
        fileAccessor: FileAccessorProviding = DefaultFileAccessor()
    ) {
        self.fileSystem = fileSystem
        self.fileAccessor = fileAccessor
    }

    public func sync() async throws {
        guard let containerURL = fileSystem.containerURL(for: .sync) else {
            throw SyncError.containerNotAvailable
        }
        let data = try fileAccessor.read(
            from: containerURL.appendingPathComponent("data.json")
        )
        // Process data...
    }
}
```

### 5. Write Tests with Swift Testing

```swift
import Testing

@Test("Sync manager handles missing container")
func testMissingContainer() async {
    let mockFileSystem = MockFileSystemProvider(containerURL: nil)
    let manager = SyncManager(fileSystem: mockFileSystem)

    await #expect(throws: SyncError.containerNotAvailable) {
        try await manager.sync()
    }
}

@Test("Sync manager reads data correctly")
func testReadData() async throws {
    let mockFileAccessor = MockFileAccessor()
    mockFileAccessor.files[testURL] = testData

    let manager = SyncManager(fileAccessor: mockFileAccessor)
    let result = try await manager.loadData()

    #expect(result == expectedData)
}

@Test("Sync manager handles read errors gracefully")
func testReadError() async {
    let mockFileAccessor = MockFileAccessor()
    mockFileAccessor.readError = CocoaError(.fileReadCorruptFile)

    let manager = SyncManager(fileAccessor: mockFileAccessor)

    await #expect(throws: SyncError.self) {
        try await manager.sync()
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Each protocol should handle one concern — don't create "god protocols" with many methods
- **Sendable conformance**: Required when protocols are used across actor boundaries
- **Default parameters**: Let production code use real implementations by default; only tests need to specify mocks
- **Error simulation**: Design mocks with configurable error properties for testing failure paths
- **Only mock boundaries**: Mock external dependencies (file system, network, APIs), not internal types

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating a single large protocol that covers all external access
- Mocking internal types that have no external dependencies
- Using `#if DEBUG` conditionals instead of proper dependency injection
- Forgetting `Sendable` conformance when used with actors
- Over-engineering: if a type has no external dependencies, it doesn't need a protocol

## When to Use

- Any Swift code that touches file system, network, or external APIs
- Testing error handling paths that are hard to trigger in real environments
- Building modules that need to work in app, test, and SwiftUI preview contexts
- Apps using Swift concurrency (actors, structured concurrency) that need testable architecture
