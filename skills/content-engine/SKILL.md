## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Build platform-native content without flattening the author's real voice into platform slop.

## When to Activate

- writing X posts or threads
- drafting LinkedIn posts or launch updates
- scripting short-form video or YouTube explainers
- repurposing articles, podcasts, demos, docs, or internal notes into public content
- building a launch sequence or ongoing content system around a product, insight, or narrative

## Non-Negotiables

1. Start from source material, not generic post formulas.
2. Adapt the format for the platform, not the persona.
3. One post should carry one actual claim.
4. Specificity beats adjectives.
5. No engagement bait unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Source-First Workflow

Before drafting, identify the source set:
- published articles
- notes or internal memos
- product demos
- docs or changelogs
- transcripts
- screenshots
- prior posts from the same author

If the user wants a specific voice, build a voice profile from real examples before writing.
Use `brand-voice` as the canonical workflow when voice consistency matters across more than one output.

## Voice Handling

`brand-voice` is the canonical voice layer.

Run it first when:

- there are multiple downstream outputs
- the user explicitly cares about writing style
- the content is launch, outreach, or reputation-sensitive

Reuse the resulting `VOICE PROFILE` here instead of rebuilding a second voice model.
If the user wants Affaan / ECC voice specifically, still treat `brand-voice` as the source of truth and feed it the best live or source-derived material available.

## Hard Bans

Delete and rewrite any of these:
- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape"
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"
- "here's why this matters" unless it is followed immediately by something concrete
- ending with a LinkedIn-style question just to farm replies
- forced casualness on LinkedIn
- fake engagement padding that was not present in the source material

## Platform Adaptation Rules

### X

- open with the strongest claim, artifact, or tension
- keep the compression if the source voice is compressed
- if writing a thread, each post must advance the argument
- do not pad with context the audience does not need

### LinkedIn

- expand only enough for people outside the immediate niche to follow
- do not turn it into a fake lesson post unless the source material actually is reflective
- no corporate inspiration cadence
- no praise-stacking, no "journey" filler

### Short Video

- script around the visual sequence and proof points
- first seconds should show the result, problem, or punch
- do not write narration that sounds better on paper than on screen

### YouTube

- show the result or tension early
- organize by argument or progression, not filler sections
- use chaptering only when it helps clarity

### Newsletter

- open with the point, conflict, or artifact
- do not spend the first paragraph warming up
- every section needs to add something new

## Repurposing Flow

1. Pick the anchor asset.
2. Extract 3 to 7 atomic claims or scenes.
3. Rank them by sharpness, novelty, and proof.
4. Assign one strong idea per output.
5. Adapt structure for each platform.
6. Strip platform-shaped filler.
7. Run the quality gate.

## Deliverables

When asked for a campaign, return:
- a short voice profile if voice matching matters
- the core angle
- platform-native drafts
- posting order only if it helps execution
- gaps that must be filled before publishing

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- every draft sounds like the intended author, not the platform stereotype
- every draft contains a real claim, proof point, or concrete observation
- no generic hype language remains
- no fake engagement bait remains
- no duplicated copy across platforms unless requested
- any CTA is earned and user-approved

## Related Skills

- `brand-voice` for source-derived voice profiles
- `crosspost` for platform-specific distribution
- `x-api` for sourcing recent posts and publishing approved X output
