# Deep Research

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Not this skill: for ESG/sustainability research tasks, use the `feynman` skill's
`-DeepResearch` mode instead — it produces cited briefs in Feynman's format and
is the one named in `manageesg-backend/AGENTS.md`'s research-tool guidance.
Use this generic firecrawl/exa skill for general web research unrelated to
Feynman.

Produce thorough, cited research reports from multiple web sources using firecrawl and exa MCP tools.

## When to Activate

- User asks to research any topic in depth
- Competitive analysis, technology evaluation, or market sizing
- Due diligence on companies, investors, or technologies
- Any question requiring synthesis from multiple sources
- User says "research", "deep dive", "investigate", or "what's the current state of"

## MCP Requirements

At least one of:
- **firecrawl** — `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_crawl`
- **exa** — `web_search_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa`, `crawling_exa`

Both together give the best coverage. Configure in `~/.claude.json` or `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Goal

Ask 1-2 quick clarifying questions:
- "What's your goal — learning, making a decision, or writing something?"
- "Any specific angle or depth you want?"

If the user says "just research it" — skip ahead with reasonable defaults.

### Step 2: Plan the Research

Break the topic into 3-5 research sub-questions. Example:
- Topic: "Impact of AI on healthcare"
  - What are the main AI applications in healthcare today?
  - What clinical outcomes have been measured?
  - What are the regulatory challenges?
  - What companies are leading this space?
  - What's the market size and growth trajectory?

### Step 3: Execute Multi-Source Search

For EACH sub-question, search using available MCP tools:

**With firecrawl:**
```
firecrawl_search(query: "<sub-question keywords>", limit: 8)
```

**With exa:**
```
web_search_exa(query: "<sub-question keywords>", numResults: 8)
web_search_advanced_exa(query: "<keywords>", numResults: 5, startPublishedDate: "2025-01-01")
```

**Search strategy:**
- Use 2-3 different keyword variations per sub-question
- Mix general and news-focused queries
- Aim for 15-30 unique sources total
- Prioritize: academic, official, reputable news > blogs > forums

### Step 4: Deep-Read Key Sources

For the most promising URLs, fetch full content:

**With firecrawl:**
```
firecrawl_scrape(url: "<url>")
```

**With exa:**
```
crawling_exa(url: "<url>", tokensNum: 5000)
```

Read 3-5 key sources in full for depth. Do not rely only on search snippets.

### Step 5: Synthesize and Write Report

Structure the report:

```markdown
# [Topic]: Research Report
*Generated: [date] | Sources: [N] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]*

## Executive Summary
[3-5 sentence overview of key findings]

## 1. [First Major Theme]
[Findings with inline citations]
- Key point ([Source Name](url))
- Supporting data ([Source Name](url))

## 2. [Second Major Theme]
...

## 3. [Third Major Theme]
...

## Key Takeaways
- [Actionable insight 1]
- [Actionable insight 2]
- [Actionable insight 3]

## Sources
1. [Title](url) — [one-line summary]
2. ...

## Methodology
Searched [N] queries across web and news. Analyzed [M] sources.
Sub-questions investigated: [list]
```

### Step 6: Deliver

- **Short topics**: Post the full report in chat
- **Long reports**: Post the executive summary + key takeaways, save full report to a file

## Parallel Research with Subagents

For broad topics, use Claude Code's Task tool to parallelize:

```
Launch 3 research agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Research sub-questions 1-2
2. Agent 2: Research sub-questions 3-4
3. Agent 3: Research sub-question 5 + cross-cutting themes
```

Each agent searches, reads sources, and returns findings. The main session synthesizes into the final report.

## Quality Rules

1. **Every claim needs a source.** No unsourced assertions.
2. **Cross-reference.** If only one source says it, flag it as unverified.
3. **Recency matters.** Prefer sources from the last 12 months.
4. **Acknowledge gaps.** If you couldn't find good info on a sub-question, say so.
5. **No hallucination.** If you don't know, say "insufficient data found."
6. **Separate fact from inference.** Label estimates, projections, and opinions clearly.

## Examples

```
"Research the current state of nuclear fusion energy"
"Deep dive into Rust vs Go for backend services in 2026"
"Research the best strategies for bootstrapping a SaaS business"
"What's happening with the US housing market right now?"
"Investigate the competitive landscape for AI code editors"
```
