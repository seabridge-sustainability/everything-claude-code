# Next.js and Turbopack

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Next.js 16+ uses Turbopack by default for local development: an incremental bundler written in Rust that significantly speeds up dev startup and hot updates.

## When to Use

- **Turbopack (default dev)**: Use for day-to-day development. Faster cold start and HMR, especially in large apps.
- **Webpack (legacy dev)**: Use only if you hit a Turbopack bug or rely on a webpack-only plugin in dev. Disable with `--webpack` (or `--no-turbopack` depending on your Next.js version; check the docs for your release).
- **Production**: Production build behavior (`next build`) may use Turbopack or webpack depending on Next.js version; check the official Next.js docs for your version.

Use when: developing or debugging Next.js 16+ apps, diagnosing slow dev startup or HMR, or optimizing production bundles.

## How It Works

- **Turbopack**: Incremental bundler for Next.js dev. Uses file-system caching so restarts are much faster (e.g. 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14x on large projects).
- **Default in dev**: From Next.js 16, `next dev` runs with Turbopack unless disabled.
- **File-system caching**: Restarts reuse previous work; cache is typically under `.next`; no extra config needed for basic use.
- **Bundle Analyzer (Next.js 16.1+)**: Experimental Bundle Analyzer to inspect output and find heavy dependencies; enable via config or experimental flag (see Next.js docs for your version).

## Examples

### Commands

```bash
next dev
next build
next start
```

### Usage

Run `next dev` for local development with Turbopack. Use the Bundle Analyzer (see Next.js docs) to optimize code-splitting and trim large dependencies. Prefer App Router and server components where possible.

## Best Practices

- Stay on a recent Next.js 16.x for stable Turbopack and caching behavior.
- If dev is slow, ensure you're on Turbopack (default) and that the cache isn't being cleared unnecessarily.
- For production bundle size issues, use the official Next.js bundle analysis tooling for your version.
