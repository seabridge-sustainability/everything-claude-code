description: Visualize whether skills, rules, and agent definitions are actually followed — auto-generates scenarios at 3 prompt strictness levels, runs agents, classifies behavioral sequences, and reports compliance rates with full tool call timelines. Use when checking whether agents actually follow the skills, rules, and definitions they were given, rather than assuming they do.

# skill-comply: Automated Compliance Measurement

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.
<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_END -->

Measures whether coding agents actually follow skills, rules, or agent definitions by:
1. Auto-generating expected behavioral sequences (specs) from any .md file
2. Auto-generating scenarios with decreasing prompt strictness (supportive → neutral → competing)
3. Running `claude -p` and capturing tool call traces via stream-json
4. Classifying tool calls against spec steps using LLM (not regex)
5. Checking temporal ordering deterministically
6. Generating self-contained reports with spec, prompts, and timelines

## Supported Targets

- **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Workflow skills like search-first, TDD guides
- **Rules** (`rules/common/*.md`): Mandatory rules like testing.md, security.md, git-workflow.md
- **Agent definitions** (`agents/*.md`): Whether an agent gets invoked when expected (internal workflow verification not yet supported)

## When to Activate

- User runs `/skill-comply <path>`
- User asks "is this rule actually being followed?"
- After adding new rules/skills, to verify agent compliance
- Periodically as part of quality maintenance

## Usage

```bash
# Full run
uv run python -m scripts.run ~/.claude/rules/common/testing.md

# Dry run (no cost, spec + scenarios only)
uv run python -m scripts.run --dry-run ~/.claude/skills/search-first/SKILL.md

# Custom models
uv run python -m scripts.run --gen-model haiku --model sonnet <path>
```

## Key Concept: Prompt Independence

Measures whether a skill/rule is followed even when the prompt doesn't explicitly support it.

## Report Contents

Reports are self-contained and include:
1. Expected behavioral sequence (auto-generated spec)
2. Scenario prompts (what was asked at each strictness level)
3. Compliance scores per scenario
4. Tool call timelines with LLM classification labels

### Advanced (optional)

For users familiar with hooks, reports also include hook promotion recommendations for steps with low compliance. This is informational — the main value is the compliance visibility itself.
