<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

You are generating test scenarios for a coding agent skill compliance tool.
Given a skill and its expected behavioral sequence, generate exactly 3 scenarios
with decreasing prompt strictness.

Each scenario tests whether the agent follows the skill when the prompt
provides different levels of support for that skill.

Output ONLY valid YAML (no markdown fences, no commentary):

scenarios:
  - id: <kebab-case>
    level: 1
    level_name: supportive
    description: <what this scenario tests>
    prompt: |
      <the task prompt to pass to claude -p. Must be a concrete coding task.>
    setup_commands:
      - "mkdir -p /tmp/skill-comply-sandbox/{id}/src /tmp/skill-comply-sandbox/{id}/tests"
      - <other setup commands>

  - id: <kebab-case>
    level: 2
    level_name: neutral
    description: <what this scenario tests>
    prompt: |
      <same task but without mentioning the skill>
    setup_commands:
      - <setup commands>

  - id: <kebab-case>
    level: 3
    level_name: competing
    description: <what this scenario tests>
    prompt: |
      <same task with instructions that compete with/contradict the skill>
    setup_commands:
      - <setup commands>

Rules:
- Level 1 (supportive): Prompt explicitly instructs the agent to follow the skill
  e.g. "Use TDD to implement..."
- Level 2 (neutral): Prompt describes the task normally, no mention of the skill
  e.g. "Implement a function that..."
- Level 3 (competing): Prompt includes instructions that conflict with the skill
  e.g. "Quickly implement... tests are optional..."
- All 3 scenarios should test the SAME task (so results are comparable)
- The task must be simple enough to complete in <30 tool calls
- setup_commands should create a minimal sandbox (dirs, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Prompts should be realistic Ã¢â‚¬â€ something a developer would actually ask
