# NanoClaw REPL

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Use this skill when running or extending `scripts/claw.js`.

## Capabilities

- persistent markdown-backed sessions
- model switching with `/model`
- dynamic skill loading with `/load`
- session branching with `/branch`
- cross-session search with `/search`
- history compaction with `/compact`
- export to md/json/txt with `/export`
- session metrics with `/metrics`

## Operating Guidance

1. Keep sessions task-focused.
2. Branch before high-risk changes.
3. Compact after major milestones.
4. Export before sharing or archival.

## Extension Rules

- keep zero external runtime dependencies
- preserve markdown-as-database compatibility
- keep command handlers deterministic and local
