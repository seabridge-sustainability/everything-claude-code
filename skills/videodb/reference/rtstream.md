## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## Overview

RTStream enables real-time ingestion of live video streams (RTSP/RTMP) and desktop capture sessions. Once connected, you can record, index, search, and export content from live sources.

For code-level details (SDK methods, parameters, examples), see [rtstream-reference.md](rtstream-reference.md).

## Use Cases

- **Security & Monitoring**: Connect RTSP cameras, detect events, trigger alerts
- **Live Broadcasts**: Ingest RTMP streams, index in real-time, enable instant search
- **Meeting Recording**: Capture desktop screen and audio, transcribe live, export recordings
- **Event Processing**: Monitor live feeds, run AI analysis, respond to detected content

## Quick Start

1. **Connect to a live stream** (RTSP/RTMP URL) or get RTStream from a capture session

2. **Start ingestion** to begin recording the live content

3. **Start AI pipelines** for real-time indexing (audio, visual, transcription)

4. **Monitor events** via WebSocket for live AI results and alerts

5. **Stop ingestion** when done

6. **Export to video** for permanent storage and further processing

7. **Search the recording** to find specific moments

## RTStream Sources

### From RTSP/RTMP Streams

Connect directly to a live video source:

```python
rtstream = coll.connect_rtstream(
    url="rtmp://your-stream-server/live/stream-key",
    name="My Live Stream",
)
```

### From Capture Sessions

Get RTStreams from desktop capture (mic, screen, system audio):

```python
session = conn.get_capture_session(session_id)

mics = session.get_rtstream("mic")
displays = session.get_rtstream("screen")
system_audios = session.get_rtstream("system_audio")
```

For capture session workflow, see [capture.md](capture.md).
