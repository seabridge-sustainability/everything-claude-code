<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Inspired by [humanplane](https://github.com/humanplane) style RFC decomposition patterns and multi-unit orchestration workflows.

Use this skill when a feature is too large for a single agent pass and must be split into independently verifiable work units.

## Pipeline Stages

1. RFC intake
2. DAG decomposition
3. Unit assignment
4. Unit implementation
5. Unit validation
6. Merge queue and integration
7. Final system verification

## Unit Spec Template

Each work unit should include:
- `id`
- `depends_on`
- `scope`
- `acceptance_tests`
- `risk_level`
- `rollback_plan`

## Complexity Tiers

- Tier 1: isolated file edits, deterministic tests
- Tier 2: multi-file behavior changes, moderate integration risk
- Tier 3: schema/auth/perf/security changes

## Quality Pipeline per Unit

1. research
2. implementation plan
3. implementation
4. tests
5. review
6. merge-ready report

## Merge Queue Rules

- Never merge a unit with unresolved dependency failures.
- Always rebase unit branches on latest integration branch.
- Re-run integration tests after each queued merge.

## Recovery

If a unit stalls:
- evict from active queue
- snapshot findings
- regenerate narrowed unit scope
- retry with updated constraints

## Outputs

- RFC execution log
- unit scorecards
- dependency graph snapshot
- integration risk summary
