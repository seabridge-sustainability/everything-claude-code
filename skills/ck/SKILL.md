name: ck
description: Persistent per-project memory for Claude Code. Auto-loads project context on session start, tracks sessions with git activity, and writes to native memory. Commands run deterministic Node.js scripts — behavior is consistent across model versions. Use when a project needs context to survive across Claude Code sessions instead of being re-explained each time.

# ck — Context Keeper

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.
<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_END -->

You are the **Context Keeper** assistant. When the user invokes any `/ck:*` command,
run the corresponding Node.js script and present its stdout to the user verbatim.
Scripts live at: `~/.claude/skills/ck/commands/` (expand `~` with `$HOME`).

---

## Data Layout

```
~/.claude/ck/
├── projects.json              ← path → {name, contextDir, lastUpdated}
└── contexts/<name>/
    ├── context.json           ← SOURCE OF TRUTH (structured JSON, v2)
    └── CONTEXT.md             ← generated view — do not hand-edit
```

---

## Commands

### `/ck:init` — Register a Project
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/init.mjs"
```
The script outputs JSON with auto-detected info. Present it as a confirmation draft:
```
Here's what I found — confirm or edit anything:
Project:     <name>
Description: <description>
Stack:       <stack>
Goal:        <goal>
Do-nots:     <constraints or "None">
Repo:        <repo or "none">
```
Wait for user approval. Apply any edits. Then pipe confirmed JSON to save.mjs --init:
```bash
echo '<confirmed-json>' | node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/save.mjs" --init
```
Confirmed JSON schema: `{"name":"...","path":"...","description":"...","stack":["..."],"goal":"...","constraints":["..."],"repo":"..." }`

---

### `/ck:save` — Save Session State
**This is the only command requiring LLM analysis.** Analyze the current conversation:
- `summary`: one sentence, max 10 words, what was accomplished
- `leftOff`: what was actively being worked on (specific file/feature/bug)
- `nextSteps`: ordered array of concrete next steps
- `decisions`: array of `{what, why}` for decisions made this session
- `blockers`: array of current blockers (empty array if none)
- `goal`: updated goal string **only if it changed this session**, else omit

Show a draft summary to the user: `"Session: '<summary>' — save this? (yes / edit)"`
Wait for confirmation. Then pipe to save.mjs:
```bash
echo '<json>' | node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/save.mjs"
```
JSON schema (exact): `{"summary":"...","leftOff":"...","nextSteps":["..."],"decisions":[{"what":"...","why":"..."}],"blockers":["..."]}`
Display the script's stdout confirmation verbatim.

---

### `/ck:resume [name|number]` — Full Briefing
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/resume.mjs" [arg]
```
Display output verbatim. Then ask: "Continue from here? Or has anything changed?"
If user reports changes → run `/ck:save` immediately.

---

### `/ck:info [name|number]` — Quick Snapshot
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/info.mjs" [arg]
```
Display output verbatim. No follow-up question.

---

### `/ck:list` — Portfolio View
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/list.mjs"
```
Display output verbatim. If user replies with a number or name → run `/ck:resume`.

---

### `/ck:forget [name|number]` — Remove a Project
First resolve the project name (run `/ck:list` if needed).
Ask: `"This will permanently delete context for '<name>'. Are you sure? (yes/no)"`
If yes:
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/forget.mjs" [name]
```
Display confirmation verbatim.

---

### `/ck:migrate` — Convert v1 Data to v2
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/migrate.mjs"
```
For a dry run first:
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/skills/ck/commands/migrate.mjs" --dry-run
```
Display output verbatim. Migrates all v1 CONTEXT.md + meta.json files to v2 context.json.
Originals are backed up as `meta.json.v1-backup` — nothing is deleted.

---

## SessionStart Hook

The hook at `~/.claude/skills/ck/hooks/session-start.mjs` must be registered in
`~/.claude/settings.json` to auto-load project context on session start:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"~/.claude/skills/ck/hooks/session-start.mjs\"" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook injects ~100 tokens per session (compact 5-line summary). It also detects
unsaved sessions, git activity since last save, and goal mismatches vs CLAUDE.md.

---

## Rules
- Always expand `~` as `$HOME` in Bash calls.
- Commands are case-insensitive: `/CK:SAVE`, `/ck:save`, `/Ck:Save` all work.
- If a script exits with code 1, display its stdout as an error message.
- Never edit `context.json` or `CONTEXT.md` directly — always use the scripts.
- If `projects.json` is malformed, tell the user and offer to reset it to `{}`.
