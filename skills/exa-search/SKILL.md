# Exa Search

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Neural search for web content, code, companies, and people via the Exa MCP server.

## When to Activate

- User needs current web information or news
- Searching for code examples, API docs, or technical references
- Researching companies, competitors, or market players
- Finding professional profiles or people in a domain
- Running background research for any development task
- User says "search for", "look up", "find", or "what's the latest on"

## MCP Requirement

Exa MCP server must be configured. Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
"exa-web-search": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
  "env": { "EXA_API_KEY": "YOUR_EXA_API_KEY_HERE" }
}
```

Get an API key at [exa.ai](https://exa.ai).
This repo's current Exa setup documents the tool surface exposed here: `web_search_exa` and `get_code_context_exa`.
If your Exa server exposes additional tools, verify their exact names before depending on them in docs or prompts.

## Core Tools

### web_search_exa
General web search for current information, news, or facts.

```
web_search_exa(query: "latest AI developments 2026", numResults: 5)
```

**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `query` | string | required | Search query |
| `numResults` | number | 8 | Number of results |
| `type` | string | `auto` | Search mode |
| `livecrawl` | string | `fallback` | Prefer live crawling when needed |
| `category` | string | none | Optional focus such as `company` or `research paper` |

### get_code_context_exa
Find code examples and documentation from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and docs sites.

```
get_code_context_exa(query: "Python asyncio patterns", tokensNum: 3000)
```

**Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `query` | string | required | Code or API search query |
| `tokensNum` | number | 5000 | Content tokens (1000-50000) |

## Usage Patterns

### Quick Lookup
```
web_search_exa(query: "Node.js 22 new features", numResults: 3)
```

### Code Research
```
get_code_context_exa(query: "Rust error handling patterns Result type", tokensNum: 3000)
```

### Company or People Research
```
web_search_exa(query: "Vercel funding valuation 2026", numResults: 3, category: "company")
web_search_exa(query: "site:linkedin.com/in AI safety researchers Anthropic", numResults: 5)
```

### Technical Deep Dive
```
web_search_exa(query: "WebAssembly component model status and adoption", numResults: 5)
get_code_context_exa(query: "WebAssembly component model examples", tokensNum: 4000)
```

## Tips

- Use `web_search_exa` for current information, company lookups, and broad discovery
- Use search operators like `site:`, quoted phrases, and `intitle:` to narrow results
- Lower `tokensNum` (1000-2000) for focused code snippets, higher (5000+) for comprehensive context
- Use `get_code_context_exa` when you need API usage or code examples rather than general web pages
