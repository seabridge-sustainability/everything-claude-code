## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

# Investor Outreach

Write investor communication that is short, concrete, and easy to act on.

## When to Activate

- writing a cold email to an investor
- drafting a warm intro request
- sending follow-ups after a meeting or no response
- writing investor updates during a process
- tailoring outreach based on fund thesis or partner fit

## Core Rules

1. Personalize every outbound message.
2. Keep the ask low-friction.
3. Use proof instead of adjectives.
4. Stay concise.
5. Never send copy that could go to any investor.

## Voice Handling

If the user's voice matters, run `brand-voice` first and reuse its `VOICE PROFILE`.
This skill should keep the investor-specific structure and ask discipline, not recreate its own parallel voice system.

## Hard Bans

Delete and rewrite any of these:
- "I'd love to connect"
- "excited to share"
- generic thesis praise without a real tie-in
- vague founder adjectives
- begging language
- soft closing questions when a direct ask is clearer

## Cold Email Structure

1. subject line: short and specific
2. opener: why this investor specifically
3. pitch: what the company does, why now, and what proof matters
4. ask: one concrete next step
5. sign-off: name, role, and one credibility anchor if needed

## Personalization Sources

Reference one or more of:
- relevant portfolio companies
- a public thesis, talk, post, or article
- a mutual connection
- a clear market or product fit with the investor's focus

If that context is missing, state that the draft still needs personalization instead of pretending it is finished.

## Follow-Up Cadence

Default:
- day 0: initial outbound
- day 4 or 5: short follow-up with one new data point
- day 10 to 12: final follow-up with a clean close

Do not keep nudging after that unless the user wants a longer sequence.

## Warm Intro Requests

Make life easy for the connector:
- explain why the intro is a fit
- include a forwardable blurb
- keep the forwardable blurb under 100 words

## Post-Meeting Updates

Include:
- the specific thing discussed
- the answer or update promised
- one new proof point if available
- the next step

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- the message is genuinely personalized
- the ask is explicit
- the proof point is concrete
- filler praise and softener language are gone
- word count stays tight
