## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

description: Create platform-native content systems for X, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, newsletters, and repurposed multi-platform campaigns. Use when the user wants social posts, threads, scripts, content calendars, or one source asset adapted cleanly across platforms.

# Content Engine

Turn one idea into strong, platform-native content instead of posting the same thing everywhere.

## When to Activate

- writing X posts or threads
- drafting LinkedIn posts or launch updates
- scripting short-form video or YouTube explainers
- repurposing articles, podcasts, demos, or docs into social content
- building a lightweight content plan around a launch, milestone, or theme

## First Questions

Clarify:
- source asset: what are we adapting from
- audience: builders, investors, customers, operators, or general audience
- platform: X, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, newsletter, or multi-platform
- goal: awareness, conversion, recruiting, authority, launch support, or engagement

## Core Rules

1. Adapt for the platform. Do not cross-post the same copy.
2. Hooks matter more than summaries.
3. Every post should carry one clear idea.
4. Use specifics over slogans.
5. Keep the ask small and clear.

## Platform Guidance

### X
- open fast
- one idea per post or per tweet in a thread
- keep links out of the main body unless necessary
- avoid hashtag spam

### LinkedIn
- strong first line
- short paragraphs
- more explicit framing around lessons, results, and takeaways

### TikTok / Short Video
- first 3 seconds must interrupt attention
- script around visuals, not just narration
- one demo, one claim, one CTA

### YouTube
- show the result early
- structure by chapter
- refresh the visual every 20-30 seconds

### Newsletter
- deliver one clear lens, not a bundle of unrelated items
- make section titles skimmable
- keep the opening paragraph doing real work

## Repurposing Flow

Default cascade:
1. anchor asset: article, video, demo, memo, or launch doc
2. extract 3-7 atomic ideas
3. write platform-native variants
4. trim repetition across outputs
5. align CTAs with platform intent

## Deliverables

When asked for a campaign, return:
- the core angle
- platform-specific drafts
- optional posting order
- optional CTA variants
- any missing inputs needed before publishing

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- each draft reads natively for its platform
- hooks are strong and specific
- no generic hype language
- no duplicated copy across platforms unless requested
- the CTA matches the content and audience
