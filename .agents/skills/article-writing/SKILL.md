## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

# Article Writing

Write long-form content that sounds like a real person or brand, not generic AI output.

## When to Activate

- drafting blog posts, essays, launch posts, guides, tutorials, or newsletter issues
- turning notes, transcripts, or research into polished articles
- matching an existing founder, operator, or brand voice from examples
- tightening structure, pacing, and evidence in already-written long-form copy

## Core Rules

1. Lead with the concrete thing: example, output, anecdote, number, screenshot description, or code block.
2. Explain after the example, not before.
3. Prefer short, direct sentences over padded ones.
4. Use specific numbers when available and sourced.
5. Never invent biographical facts, company metrics, or customer evidence.

## Voice Capture Workflow

If the user wants a specific voice, collect one or more of:
- published articles
- newsletters
- X / LinkedIn posts
- docs or memos
- a short style guide

Then extract:
- sentence length and rhythm
- whether the voice is formal, conversational, or sharp
- favored rhetorical devices such as parentheses, lists, fragments, or questions
- tolerance for humor, opinion, and contrarian framing
- formatting habits such as headers, bullets, code blocks, and pull quotes

If no voice references are given, default to a direct, operator-style voice: concrete, practical, and low on hype.

## Banned Patterns

Delete and rewrite any of these:
- generic openings like "In today's rapidly evolving landscape"
- filler transitions such as "Moreover" and "Furthermore"
- hype phrases like "game-changer", "cutting-edge", or "revolutionary"
- vague claims without evidence
- biography or credibility claims not backed by provided context

## Writing Process

1. Clarify the audience and purpose.
2. Build a skeletal outline with one purpose per section.
3. Start each section with evidence, example, or scene.
4. Expand only where the next sentence earns its place.
5. Remove anything that sounds templated or self-congratulatory.

## Structure Guidance

### Technical Guides
- open with what the reader gets
- use code or terminal examples in every major section
- end with concrete takeaways, not a soft summary

### Essays / Opinion Pieces
- start with tension, contradiction, or a sharp observation
- keep one argument thread per section
- use examples that earn the opinion

### Newsletters
- keep the first screen strong
- mix insight with updates, not diary filler
- use clear section labels and easy skim structure

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- verify factual claims against provided sources
- remove filler and corporate language
- confirm the voice matches the supplied examples
- ensure every section adds new information
- check formatting for the intended platform
