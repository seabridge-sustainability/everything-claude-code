## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

# Strategic Compact Skill

Suggests manual `/compact` at strategic points in your workflow rather than relying on arbitrary auto-compaction.

## When to Activate

- Running long sessions that approach context limits (200K+ tokens)
- Working on multi-phase tasks (research Ã¢â€ â€™ plan Ã¢â€ â€™ implement Ã¢â€ â€™ test)
- Switching between unrelated tasks within the same session
- After completing a major milestone and starting new work
- When responses slow down or become less coherent (context pressure)

## Why Strategic Compaction?

Auto-compaction triggers at arbitrary points:
- Often mid-task, losing important context
- No awareness of logical task boundaries
- Can interrupt complex multi-step operations

Strategic compaction at logical boundaries:
- **After exploration, before execution** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Compact research context, keep implementation plan
- **After completing a milestone** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Fresh start for next phase
- **Before major context shifts** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Clear exploration context before different task

## How It Works

The `suggest-compact.js` script runs on PreToolUse (Edit/Write) and:

1. **Tracks tool calls** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Counts tool invocations in session
2. **Threshold detection** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Suggests at configurable threshold (default: 50 calls)
3. **Periodic reminders** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Reminds every 25 calls after threshold

## Hook Setup

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.js" }]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.js" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `COMPACT_THRESHOLD` Ã¢â‚¬â€ Tool calls before first suggestion (default: 50)

## Compaction Decision Guide

Use this table to decide when to compact:

| Phase Transition | Compact? | Why |
|-----------------|----------|-----|
| Research Ã¢â€ â€™ Planning | Yes | Research context is bulky; plan is the distilled output |
| Planning Ã¢â€ â€™ Implementation | Yes | Plan is in TodoWrite or a file; free up context for code |
| Implementation Ã¢â€ â€™ Testing | Maybe | Keep if tests reference recent code; compact if switching focus |
| Debugging Ã¢â€ â€™ Next feature | Yes | Debug traces pollute context for unrelated work |
| Mid-implementation | No | Losing variable names, file paths, and partial state is costly |
| After a failed approach | Yes | Clear the dead-end reasoning before trying a new approach |

## What Survives Compaction

Understanding what persists helps you compact with confidence:

| Persists | Lost |
|----------|------|
| CLAUDE.md instructions | Intermediate reasoning and analysis |
| TodoWrite task list | File contents you previously read |
| Memory files (`~/.claude/memory/`) | Multi-step conversation context |
| Git state (commits, branches) | Tool call history and counts |
| Files on disk | Nuanced user preferences stated verbally |

## Best Practices

1. **Compact after planning** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Once plan is finalized in TodoWrite, compact to start fresh
2. **Compact after debugging** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Clear error-resolution context before continuing
3. **Don't compact mid-implementation** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Preserve context for related changes
4. **Read the suggestion** Ã¢â‚¬â€ The hook tells you *when*, you decide *if*
5. **Write before compacting** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Save important context to files or memory before compacting
6. **Use `/compact` with a summary** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Add a custom message: `/compact Focus on implementing auth middleware next`
