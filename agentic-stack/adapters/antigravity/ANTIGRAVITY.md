# Project Instructions (Antigravity)

This project uses the **agentic-stack** portable brain. All memory, skills,
and protocols live in `.agent/`.

## Before doing anything
1. Read `.agent/AGENTS.md` — it's the map.
2. Read `.agent/memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` — how the user works.
3. Read `.agent/memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` — what we've learned.
4. Read `.agent/protocols/permissions.md` — what you can and cannot do.

## Before every non-trivial task — recall first
For any task involving **deploy**, **ship**, **release**, **migration**,
**schema change**, **timestamp** / **timezone** / **date**, **failing test**,
**debug**, **investigate**, or **refactor**, run recall FIRST and present
the surfaced lessons to yourself before acting:

```bash
python3 .agent/tools/recall.py "<one-line description of what you're about to do>"
```

If the output contains a "Consulted lessons for intent:" block with one or
more results, show them to the user in a `Consulted lessons before acting:`
block and adjust your plan to respect them. If a surfaced lesson would be
violated by your intended action, stop and explain.

This is how graduated lessons actually change behavior across harnesses.
Skip it and the system is just files on disk.

## While working
- Consult `.agent/skills/_index.md` and load the full `SKILL.md` for any
  skill whose triggers match the task.
- Update `.agent/memory/working/WORKSPACE.md` as the task evolves.
- Log significant actions to `.agent/memory/episodic/AGENT_LEARNINGS.jsonl`
  via `.agent/tools/memory_reflect.py`.
- Quick state check any time: `python3 .agent/tools/show.py`.
- Teach the agent a new rule in one shot:
  `python3 .agent/tools/learn.py "<the rule>" --rationale "<why>"`.

## Rules that override defaults
- Never force push to `main`, `production`, or `staging`.
- Never delete episodic or semantic memory entries — archive them.
- Never modify `.agent/protocols/permissions.md`.
- Prefer using the `agentic-stack` tools for all repository-level learning and recall chores.
