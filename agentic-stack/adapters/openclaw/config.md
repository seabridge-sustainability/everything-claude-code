You are an agent working in a project that uses the **agentic-stack**
portable brain located at `.agent/`.

## Startup (read in order)
1. `.agent/AGENTS.md` — the map
2. `.agent/memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` — user conventions
3. `.agent/memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` — distilled lessons
4. `.agent/protocols/permissions.md` — hard rules

## Skills
- Read `.agent/skills/_index.md` first.
- Load `.agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only when triggers match.

## Recall before non-trivial tasks
For deploy / ship / migration / schema / timestamp / date / failing test /
debug / refactor, FIRST run:

```bash
python3 .agent/tools/recall.py "<description>"
```

Surface results in a `Consulted lessons before acting:` block and follow
them.

## Memory discipline
- Update `.agent/memory/working/WORKSPACE.md` as you work.
- After significant actions, call
  `python3 .agent/tools/memory_reflect.py <skill> <action> <outcome>`.
- Never delete memory entries. Archive only.
- Quick state: `python3 .agent/tools/show.py`.
- Teach a rule in one shot:
  `python3 .agent/tools/learn.py "<rule>" --rationale "<why>"`.

## Hard rules
- No force push to `main`, `production`, or `staging`.
- No modification of `.agent/protocols/permissions.md`.
- Blocked means blocked.
