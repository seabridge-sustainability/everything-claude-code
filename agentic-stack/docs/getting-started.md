# Getting Started

## 1. Clone or drop `.agent/` into your project

```bash
# new project
git clone https://github.com/<you>/agentic-stack.git my-project
cd my-project

# or add to an existing project
cp -R /path/to/agentic-stack/.agent ./
cp /path/to/agentic-stack/install.sh ./
```

## 2. Pick your harness

```bash
./install.sh claude-code        # or cursor, windsurf, opencode,
                                # openclaw, hermes, standalone-python
```

Each adapter has its own `README.md` under `adapters/<name>/`.

## 3. Customize `PREFERENCES.md`

Open `.agent/memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` and fill in 5–10 lines about
your code style, workflow, and constraints. This is the one file every
user should customize on day one.

## 4. Run the dream cycle on a schedule

```bash
crontab -e
# nightly at 3am:
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/project && python3 .agent/memory/auto_dream.py >> .agent/memory/dream.log 2>&1
```

## 5. Start using it

Open your harness and ask it anything. The first few days it will feel
stateless. After ~2 weeks you'll notice it checking past lessons, logging
failures with reflection, and (if you let it) proposing skill rewrites.

## Verify the wiring
```bash
python3 .agent/tools/budget_tracker.py "commit and push"
# tokens_used, chars, budget, headroom
```

If `tokens_used` is 0, your memory files aren't being read — check paths.
