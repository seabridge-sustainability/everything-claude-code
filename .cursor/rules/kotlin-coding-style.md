# Kotlin Coding Style

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

> This file extends the common coding style rule with Kotlin-specific content.

## Formatting

- Auto-formatting via **ktfmt** or **ktlint** (configured in `kotlin-hooks.md`)
- Use trailing commas in multiline declarations

## Immutability

The global immutability requirement is enforced in the common coding style rule.
For Kotlin specifically:

- Prefer `val` over `var`
- Use immutable collection types (`List`, `Map`, `Set`)
- Use `data class` with `copy()` for immutable updates

## Null Safety

- Avoid `!!` -- use `?.`, `?:`, `require`, or `checkNotNull`
- Handle platform types explicitly at Java interop boundaries

## Expression Bodies

Prefer expression bodies for single-expression functions:

```kotlin
fun isAdult(age: Int): Boolean = age >= 18
```

## Reference

See skill: `kotlin-patterns` for comprehensive Kotlin idioms and patterns.
