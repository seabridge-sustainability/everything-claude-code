# Kotlin Security

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

> This file extends the common security rule with Kotlin-specific content.

## Secret Management

```kotlin
val apiKey = System.getenv("API_KEY")
    ?: throw IllegalStateException("API_KEY not configured")
```

## SQL Injection Prevention

Always use Exposed's parameterized queries:

```kotlin
// Good: Parameterized via Exposed DSL
UsersTable.selectAll().where { UsersTable.email eq email }

// Bad: String interpolation in raw SQL
exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'")
```

## Authentication

Use Ktor's Auth plugin with JWT:

```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
    jwt("jwt") {
        verifier(
            JWT.require(Algorithm.HMAC256(secret))
                .withAudience(audience)
                .withIssuer(issuer)
                .build()
        )
        validate { credential ->
            val payload = credential.payload
            if (payload.audience.contains(audience) &&
                payload.issuer == issuer &&
                payload.subject != null) {
                JWTPrincipal(payload)
            } else {
                null
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Null Safety as Security

Kotlin's type system prevents null-related vulnerabilities -- avoid `!!` to maintain this guarantee.
