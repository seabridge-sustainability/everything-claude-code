<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Turn one idea into strong, platform-native content instead of posting the same thing everywhere.

## When to Activate

- writing X posts or threads
- drafting LinkedIn posts or launch updates
- scripting short-form video or YouTube explainers
- repurposing articles, podcasts, demos, or docs into social content
- building a lightweight content plan around a launch, milestone, or theme

## First Questions

Clarify:
- source asset: what are we adapting from
- audience: builders, investors, customers, operators, or general audience
- platform: X, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, newsletter, or multi-platform
- goal: awareness, conversion, recruiting, authority, launch support, or engagement

## Core Rules

1. Adapt for the platform. Do not cross-post the same copy.
2. Hooks matter more than summaries.
3. Every post should carry one clear idea.
4. Use specifics over slogans.
5. Keep the ask small and clear.

## Platform Guidance

### X
- open fast
- one idea per post or per tweet in a thread
- keep links out of the main body unless necessary
- avoid hashtag spam

### LinkedIn
- strong first line
- short paragraphs
- more explicit framing around lessons, results, and takeaways

### TikTok / Short Video
- first 3 seconds must interrupt attention
- script around visuals, not just narration
- one demo, one claim, one CTA

### YouTube
- show the result early
- structure by chapter
- refresh the visual every 20-30 seconds

### Newsletter
- deliver one clear lens, not a bundle of unrelated items
- make section titles skimmable
- keep the opening paragraph doing real work

## Repurposing Flow

Default cascade:
1. anchor asset: article, video, demo, memo, or launch doc
2. extract 3-7 atomic ideas
3. write platform-native variants
4. trim repetition across outputs
5. align CTAs with platform intent

## Deliverables

When asked for a campaign, return:
- the core angle
- platform-specific drafts
- optional posting order
- optional CTA variants
- any missing inputs needed before publishing

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- each draft reads natively for its platform
- hooks are strong and specific
- no generic hype language
- no duplicated copy across platforms unless requested
- the CTA matches the content and audience
