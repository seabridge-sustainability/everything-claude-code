# TDD Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Implement the following using strict test-driven development: $ARGUMENTS

## TDD Cycle (MANDATORY)

```
RED Ã¢â€ â€™ GREEN Ã¢â€ â€™ REFACTOR Ã¢â€ â€™ REPEAT
```

1. **RED**: Write a failing test FIRST
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Continue until feature complete

## Your Task

### Step 1: Define Interfaces (SCAFFOLD)
- Define TypeScript interfaces for inputs/outputs
- Create function signature with `throw new Error('Not implemented')`

### Step 2: Write Failing Tests (RED)
- Write tests that exercise the interface
- Include happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Run tests - verify they FAIL

### Step 3: Implement Minimal Code (GREEN)
- Write just enough code to make tests pass
- No premature optimization
- Run tests - verify they PASS

### Step 4: Refactor (IMPROVE)
- Extract constants, improve naming
- Remove duplication
- Run tests - verify they still PASS

### Step 5: Check Coverage
- Target: 80% minimum
- 100% for critical business logic
- Add more tests if needed

## Coverage Requirements

| Code Type | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Standard code | 80% |
| Financial calculations | 100% |
| Authentication logic | 100% |
| Security-critical code | 100% |

## Test Types to Include

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions
- **Edge Cases**: Empty, null, max values, boundaries
- **Error Conditions**: Invalid inputs, network failures
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database operations

---

**MANDATORY**: Tests must be written BEFORE implementation. Never skip the RED phase.
