# TDD Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Implement the following using strict test-driven development: $ARGUMENTS

## TDD Cycle (MANDATORY)

```
RED Ã¢â€ â€™ GREEN Ã¢â€ â€™ REFACTOR Ã¢â€ â€™ REPEAT
```

1. **RED**: Write a failing test FIRST
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Continue until feature complete

## Your Task

### Step 1: Define Interfaces (SCAFFOLD)
- Define TypeScript interfaces for inputs/outputs
- Create function signature with `throw new Error('Not implemented')`

### Step 2: Write Failing Tests (RED)
- Write tests that exercise the interface
- Include happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Run tests - verify they FAIL

### Step 3: Implement Minimal Code (GREEN)
- Write just enough code to make tests pass
- No premature optimization
- Run tests - verify they PASS

### Step 4: Refactor (IMPROVE)
- Extract constants, improve naming
- Remove duplication
- Run tests - verify they still PASS

### Step 5: Check Coverage
- Target: 80% minimum
- 100% for critical business logic
- Add more tests if needed

## Coverage Requirements

| Code Type | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Standard code | 80% |
| Financial calculations | 100% |
| Authentication logic | 100% |
| Security-critical code | 100% |

## Test Types to Include

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions
- **Edge Cases**: Empty, null, max values, boundaries
- **Error Conditions**: Invalid inputs, network failures
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database operations

**MANDATORY**: Tests must be written BEFORE implementation. Never skip the RED phase.
