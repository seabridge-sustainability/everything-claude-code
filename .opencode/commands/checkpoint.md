# Checkpoint Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Save current verification state and create progress checkpoint: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Create a snapshot of current progress including:

1. **Tests status** - Which tests pass/fail
2. **Coverage** - Current coverage metrics
3. **Build status** - Build succeeds or errors
4. **Code changes** - Summary of modifications
5. **Next steps** - What remains to be done

## Checkpoint Format

### Checkpoint: [Timestamp]

**Tests**
- Total: X
- Passing: Y
- Failing: Z
- Coverage: XX%

**Build**
- Status: PASS: Passing / FAIL: Failing
- Errors: [if any]

**Changes Since Last Checkpoint**
```
git diff --stat [last-checkpoint-commit]
```

**Completed Tasks**
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3 (in progress)

**Blocking Issues**
- [Issue description]

**Next Steps**
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Usage with Verification Loop

Checkpoints integrate with the verification loop:

```
/plan Ã¢â€ â€™ implement Ã¢â€ â€™ /checkpoint Ã¢â€ â€™ /verify Ã¢â€ â€™ /checkpoint Ã¢â€ â€™ implement Ã¢â€ â€™ ...
```

Use checkpoints to:
- Save state before risky changes
- Track progress through phases
- Enable rollback if needed
- Document verification points

**TIP**: Create checkpoints at natural breakpoints: after each phase, before major refactoring, after fixing critical bugs.
