# Update Codemaps Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Update codemaps to reflect current codebase structure: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Generate or update codemaps in `docs/CODEMAPS/` directory:

1. **Analyze codebase structure**
2. **Generate component maps**
3. **Document relationships**
4. **Update navigation guides**

## Codemap Types

### Architecture Map
```
docs/CODEMAPS/ARCHITECTURE.md
```
- High-level system overview
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams

### Module Map
```
docs/CODEMAPS/MODULES.md
```
- Module descriptions
- Public APIs
- Dependencies

### File Map
```
docs/CODEMAPS/FILES.md
```
- Directory structure
- File purposes
- Key files

## Codemap Format

### [Module Name]

**Purpose**: [Brief description]

**Location**: `src/[path]/`

**Key Files**:
- `file1.ts` - [purpose]
- `file2.ts` - [purpose]

**Dependencies**:
- [Module A]
- [Module B]

**Exports**:
- `functionName()` - [description]
- `ClassName` - [description]

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { functionName } from '@/module'
```

## Generation Process

1. Scan directory structure
2. Parse imports/exports
3. Build dependency graph
4. Generate markdown maps
5. Validate links

**TIP**: Keep codemaps updated when adding new modules or significant refactoring.
