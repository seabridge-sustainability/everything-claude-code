# Plan Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Restate Requirements** - Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface potential issues, blockers, and dependencies
3. **Create Step Plan** - Break down implementation into phases
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - MUST receive user approval before proceeding

## Output Format

### Requirements Restatement
[Clear, concise restatement of what will be built]

### Implementation Phases
[Phase 1: Description]
- Step 1.1
- Step 1.2
...

[Phase 2: Description]
- Step 2.1
- Step 2.2
...

### Dependencies
[List external dependencies, APIs, services needed]

### Risks
- HIGH: [Critical risks that could block implementation]
- MEDIUM: [Moderate risks to address]
- LOW: [Minor concerns]

### Estimated Complexity
[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with time estimates]

**WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION**: Proceed with this plan? (yes/no/modify)

---

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT write any code until the user explicitly confirms with "yes", "proceed", or similar affirmative response.
