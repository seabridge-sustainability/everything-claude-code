# Instinct Import Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Import instincts from a file or URL: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Import instincts into the continuous-learning-v2 system.

## Import Sources

### File Import
```
/instinct-import path/to/instincts.json
```

### URL Import
```
/instinct-import https://example.com/instincts.json
```

### Team Share Import
```
/instinct-import @teammate/instincts
```

## Import Format

Expected JSON structure:

```json
{
  "instincts": [
    {
      "trigger": "[situation description]",
      "action": "[recommended action]",
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "category": "coding",
      "source": "imported"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "exported": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "author": "username"
  }
}
```

## Import Process

1. **Validate format** - Check JSON structure
2. **Deduplicate** - Skip existing instincts
3. **Adjust confidence** - Reduce confidence for imports (Ãƒâ€”0.8)
4. **Merge** - Add to local instinct store
5. **Report** - Show import summary

## Import Report

```
Import Summary
==============
Source: [path or URL]
Total in file: X
Imported: Y
Skipped (duplicates): Z
Errors: W

Imported Instincts:
- [trigger] (confidence: 0.XX)
- [trigger] (confidence: 0.XX)
...
```

## Conflict Resolution

When importing duplicates:
- Keep higher confidence version
- Merge application counts
- Update timestamp

**TIP**: Review imported instincts with `/instinct-status` after import.
