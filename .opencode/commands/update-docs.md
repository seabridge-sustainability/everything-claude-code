# Update Docs Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Update documentation to reflect recent changes: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Identify changed code** - `git diff --name-only`
2. **Find related docs** - README, API docs, guides
3. **Update documentation** - Keep in sync with code
4. **Verify accuracy** - Docs match implementation

## Documentation Types

### README.md
- Installation instructions
- Quick start guide
- Feature overview
- Configuration options

### API Documentation
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication details
- Error codes

### Code Comments
- JSDoc for public APIs
- Complex logic explanations
- TODO/FIXME cleanup

### Guides
- How-to tutorials
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Troubleshooting guides

## Update Checklist

- [ ] README reflects current features
- [ ] API docs match endpoints
- [ ] JSDoc updated for changed functions
- [ ] Examples are working
- [ ] Links are valid
- [ ] Version numbers updated

## Documentation Quality

### Good Documentation
- Accurate and up-to-date
- Clear and concise
- Has working examples
