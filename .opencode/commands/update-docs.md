# Update Docs Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Update documentation to reflect recent changes: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Identify changed code** - `git diff --name-only`
2. **Find related docs** - README, API docs, guides
3. **Update documentation** - Keep in sync with code
4. **Verify accuracy** - Docs match implementation

## Documentation Types

### README.md
- Installation instructions
- Quick start guide
- Feature overview
- Configuration options

### API Documentation
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication details
- Error codes

### Code Comments
- JSDoc for public APIs
- Complex logic explanations
- TODO/FIXME cleanup

### Guides
- How-to tutorials
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Troubleshooting guides

## Update Checklist

- [ ] README reflects current features
- [ ] API docs match endpoints
- [ ] JSDoc updated for changed functions
- [ ] Examples are working
- [ ] Links are valid
- [ ] Version numbers updated

## Documentation Quality

### Good Documentation
