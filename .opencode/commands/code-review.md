# Code Review Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Review code changes for quality, security, and maintainability: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Get changed files**: Run `git diff --name-only HEAD`
2. **Analyze each file** for issues
3. **Generate structured report**
4. **Provide actionable recommendations**

## Check Categories

### Security Issues (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Missing input validation
- [ ] Insecure dependencies
- [ ] Path traversal risks
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flaws

### Code Quality (HIGH)
- [ ] Functions > 50 lines
- [ ] Files > 800 lines
- [ ] Nesting depth > 4 levels
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] console.log statements
- [ ] TODO/FIXME comments
- [ ] Missing JSDoc for public APIs

### Best Practices (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- [ ] Unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Missing tests for new code
- [ ] Accessibility issues (a11y)
- [ ] Performance concerns

### Style (LOW)
- [ ] Inconsistent naming
- [ ] Missing type annotations
- [ ] Formatting issues

## Report Format

For each issue found:

```
**[SEVERITY]** file.ts:123
Issue: [Description]
Fix: [How to fix]
```

## Decision

- **CRITICAL or HIGH issues**: Block commit, require fixes
- **MEDIUM issues**: Recommend fixes before merge
- **LOW issues**: Optional improvements
