# Code Review Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Review code changes for quality, security, and maintainability: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Get changed files**: Run `git diff --name-only HEAD`
2. **Analyze each file** for issues
3. **Generate structured report**
4. **Provide actionable recommendations**

## Check Categories

### Security Issues (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Missing input validation
- [ ] Insecure dependencies
- [ ] Path traversal risks
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flaws

### Code Quality (HIGH)
- [ ] Functions > 50 lines
- [ ] Files > 800 lines
- [ ] Nesting depth > 4 levels
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] console.log statements
- [ ] TODO/FIXME comments
- [ ] Missing JSDoc for public APIs

### Best Practices (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- [ ] Unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Missing tests for new code
- [ ] Accessibility issues (a11y)
- [ ] Performance concerns

### Style (LOW)
- [ ] Inconsistent naming
- [ ] Missing type annotations
- [ ] Formatting issues

## Report Format

For each issue found:

```
**[SEVERITY]** file.ts:123
Issue: [Description]
Fix: [How to fix]
```

## Decision

- **CRITICAL or HIGH issues**: Block commit, require fixes
- **MEDIUM issues**: Recommend fixes before merge
- **LOW issues**: Optional improvements

**IMPORTANT**: Never approve code with security vulnerabilities!
