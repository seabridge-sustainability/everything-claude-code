# Learn Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Extract patterns, learnings, and reusable insights from the current session: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Analyze the conversation and code changes to extract:

1. **Patterns discovered** - Recurring solutions or approaches
2. **Best practices applied** - Techniques that worked well
3. **Mistakes to avoid** - Issues encountered and solutions
4. **Reusable snippets** - Code patterns worth saving

## Output Format

### Patterns Discovered

**Pattern: [Name]**
- Context: When to use this pattern
- Implementation: How to apply it
- Example: Code snippet

### Best Practices Applied

1. [Practice name]
   - Why it works
   - When to apply

### Mistakes to Avoid

1. [Mistake description]
   - What went wrong
   - How to prevent it

### Suggested Skill Updates

If patterns are significant, suggest updates to:
- `skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md`
- `skills/[domain]/SKILL.md`
- `rules/[category].md`

## Instinct Format (for continuous-learning-v2)

```json
{
  "trigger": "[situation that triggers this learning]",
  "action": "[what to do]",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "source": "session-extraction",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]"
}
```

**TIP**: Run `/learn` periodically during long sessions to capture insights before context compaction.
