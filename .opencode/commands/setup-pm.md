# Setup Package Manager Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Configure your preferred package manager: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Set up package manager preference for the project or globally.

## Detection Order

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Auto-detect from lock files
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Environment Variable
```bash
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm
```

### Option 2: Project Config
```bash
# Create .claude/package-manager.json
echo '{"packageManager": "pnpm"}' > .claude/package-manager.json
```

### Option 3: package.json
```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"
}
```

### Option 4: Global Config
```bash
# Create ~/.claude/package-manager.json
echo '{"packageManager": "yarn"}' > ~/.claude/package-manager.json
```

## Supported Package Managers

| Manager | Lock File | Commands |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| npm | package-lock.json | `npm install`, `npm run` |
| pnpm | pnpm-lock.yaml | `pnpm install`, `pnpm run` |
| yarn | yarn.lock | `yarn install`, `yarn run` |
| bun | bun.lockb | `bun install`, `bun run` |

## Verification

Check current setting:
```bash
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
```

**TIP**: For consistency across team, add `packageManager` field to package.json.
