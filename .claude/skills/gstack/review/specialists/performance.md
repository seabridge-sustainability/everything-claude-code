# Performance Specialist Review Checklist

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Scope: When SCOPE_BACKEND=true OR SCOPE_FRONTEND=true
Output: JSON objects, one finding per line. Schema:
{"severity":"CRITICAL|INFORMATIONAL","confidence":N,"path":"file","line":N,"category":"performance","summary":"...","fix":"...","fingerprint":"path:line:performance","specialist":"performance"}
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

## Categories

### N+1 Queries
- ActiveRecord/ORM associations traversed in loops without eager loading (.includes, joinedload, include)
- Database queries inside iteration blocks (each, map, forEach) that could be batched
- Nested serializers that trigger lazy-loaded associations
- GraphQL resolvers that query per-field instead of batching (check for DataLoader usage)

### Missing Database Indexes
- New WHERE clauses on columns without indexes (check migration files or schema)
- New ORDER BY on non-indexed columns
- Composite queries (WHERE a AND b) without composite indexes
- Foreign key columns added without indexes

### Algorithmic Complexity
- O(n^2) or worse patterns: nested loops over collections, Array.find inside Array.map
- Repeated linear searches that could use a hash/map/set lookup
- String concatenation in loops (use join or StringBuilder)
- Sorting or filtering large collections multiple times when once would suffice

### Bundle Size Impact (Frontend)
- New production dependencies that are known-heavy (moment.js, lodash full, jquery)
- Barrel imports (import from 'library') instead of deep imports (import from 'library/specific')
- Large static assets (images, fonts) committed without optimization
- Missing code splitting for route-level chunks

### Rendering Performance (Frontend)
- Fetch waterfalls: sequential API calls that could be parallel (Promise.all)
- Unnecessary re-renders from unstable references (new objects/arrays in render)
- Missing React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback on expensive computations
- Layout thrashing from reading then writing DOM properties in loops
- Missing loading="lazy" on below-fold images

### Missing Pagination
- List endpoints that return unbounded results (no LIMIT, no pagination params)
- Database queries without LIMIT that grow with data volume
- API responses that embed full nested objects instead of IDs with expansion

### Blocking in Async Contexts
- Synchronous I/O (file reads, subprocess, HTTP requests) inside async functions
- time.sleep() / Thread.sleep() inside event-loop-based handlers
- CPU-intensive computation blocking the main thread without worker offload
