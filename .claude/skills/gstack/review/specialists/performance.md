# Performance Specialist Review Checklist

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Scope: When SCOPE_BACKEND=true OR SCOPE_FRONTEND=true
Output: JSON objects, one finding per line. Schema:
{"severity":"CRITICAL|INFORMATIONAL","confidence":N,"path":"file","line":N,"category":"performance","summary":"...","fix":"...","fingerprint":"path:line:performance","specialist":"performance"}
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

## Categories

### N+1 Queries
- ActiveRecord/ORM associations traversed in loops without eager loading (.includes, joinedload, include)
- Database queries inside iteration blocks (each, map, forEach) that could be batched
- Nested serializers that trigger lazy-loaded associations
- GraphQL resolvers that query per-field instead of batching (check for DataLoader usage)

### Missing Database Indexes
- New WHERE clauses on columns without indexes (check migration files or schema)
- New ORDER BY on non-indexed columns
- Composite queries (WHERE a AND b) without composite indexes
- Foreign key columns added without indexes

### Algorithmic Complexity
- O(n^2) or worse patterns: nested loops over collections, Array.find inside Array.map
- Repeated linear searches that could use a hash/map/set lookup
- String concatenation in loops (use join or StringBuilder)
- Sorting or filtering large collections multiple times when once would suffice

### Bundle Size Impact (Frontend)
- New production dependencies that are known-heavy (moment.js, lodash full, jquery)
- Barrel imports (import from 'library') instead of deep imports (import from 'library/specific')
- Large static assets (images, fonts) committed without optimization
- Missing code splitting for route-level chunks

### Rendering Performance (Frontend)
- Fetch waterfalls: sequential API calls that could be parallel (Promise.all)
- Unnecessary re-renders from unstable references (new objects/arrays in render)
- Missing React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback on expensive computations
- Layout thrashing from reading then writing DOM properties in loops
- Missing loading="lazy" on below-fold images

### Missing Pagination
- List endpoints that return unbounded results (no LIMIT, no pagination params)
- Database queries without LIMIT that grow with data volume
- API responses that embed full nested objects instead of IDs with expansion

### Blocking in Async Contexts
- Synchronous I/O (file reads, subprocess, HTTP requests) inside async functions
- time.sleep() / Thread.sleep() inside event-loop-based handlers
- CPU-intensive computation blocking the main thread without worker offload
