# Maintainability Specialist Review Checklist

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

## Categories

### Dead Code & Unused Imports
- Variables assigned but never read in the changed files
- Functions/methods defined but never called (check with Grep across the repo)
- Imports/requires that are no longer referenced after the change
- Commented-out code blocks (either remove or explain why they exist)

### Magic Numbers & String Coupling
- Bare numeric literals used in logic (thresholds, limits, retry counts) Ã¢â‚¬â€ should be named constants
- Error message strings used as query filters or conditionals elsewhere
- Hardcoded URLs, ports, or hostnames that should be config
- Duplicated literal values across multiple files

### Stale Comments & Docstrings
- Comments that describe old behavior after the code was changed in this diff
- TODO/FIXME comments that reference completed work
- Docstrings with parameter lists that don't match the current function signature
- ASCII diagrams in comments that no longer match the code flow

### DRY Violations
- Similar code blocks (3+ lines) appearing multiple times within the diff
- Copy-paste patterns where a shared helper would be cleaner
- Configuration or setup logic duplicated across test files
- Repeated conditional chains that could be a lookup table or map

### Conditional Side Effects
- Code paths that branch on a condition but forget a side effect on one branch
- Log messages that claim an action happened but the action was conditionally skipped
- State transitions where one branch updates related records but the other doesn't
- Event emissions that only fire on the happy path, missing error/edge paths

### Module Boundary Violations
- Reaching into another module's internal implementation (accessing private-by-convention methods)
- Direct database queries in controllers/views that should go through a service/model
- Tight coupling between components that should communicate through interfaces
