# Maintainability Specialist Review Checklist

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Scope: Always-on (every review)
Output: JSON objects, one finding per line. Schema:
{"severity":"INFORMATIONAL","confidence":N,"path":"file","line":N,"category":"maintainability","summary":"...","fix":"...","fingerprint":"path:line:maintainability","specialist":"maintainability"}
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

## Categories

### Dead Code & Unused Imports
- Variables assigned but never read in the changed files
- Functions/methods defined but never called (check with Grep across the repo)
- Imports/requires that are no longer referenced after the change
- Commented-out code blocks (either remove or explain why they exist)

### Magic Numbers & String Coupling
- Bare numeric literals used in logic (thresholds, limits, retry counts) Ã¢â‚¬â€ should be named constants
- Error message strings used as query filters or conditionals elsewhere
- Hardcoded URLs, ports, or hostnames that should be config
- Duplicated literal values across multiple files

### Stale Comments & Docstrings
- Comments that describe old behavior after the code was changed in this diff
- TODO/FIXME comments that reference completed work
- Docstrings with parameter lists that don't match the current function signature
- ASCII diagrams in comments that no longer match the code flow

### DRY Violations
- Similar code blocks (3+ lines) appearing multiple times within the diff
- Copy-paste patterns where a shared helper would be cleaner
- Configuration or setup logic duplicated across test files
- Repeated conditional chains that could be a lookup table or map

### Conditional Side Effects
- Code paths that branch on a condition but forget a side effect on one branch
- Log messages that claim an action happened but the action was conditionally skipped
- State transitions where one branch updates related records but the other doesn't
- Event emissions that only fire on the happy path, missing error/edge paths

### Module Boundary Violations
- Reaching into another module's internal implementation (accessing private-by-convention methods)
- Direct database queries in controllers/views that should go through a service/model
- Tight coupling between components that should communicate through interfaces
