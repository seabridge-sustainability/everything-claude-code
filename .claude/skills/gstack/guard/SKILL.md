  Full safety mode: destructive command warnings + directory-scoped edits.
  Combines /careful (warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc.) with
  /freeze (blocks edits outside a specified directory). Use for maximum safety
  when touching prod or debugging live systems. Use when asked to "guard mode",
  "full safety", "lock it down", or "maximum safety". (gstack)

# /guard Ã¢â‚¬â€ Full Safety Mode

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

Activates both destructive command warnings and directory-scoped edit restrictions.
This is the combination of `/careful` + `/freeze` in a single command.

**Dependency note:** This skill references hook scripts from the sibling `/careful`
and `/freeze` skill directories. Both must be installed (they are installed together
by the gstack setup script).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"guard","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Guard mode: which directory should edits be restricted to? Destructive command warnings are always on. Files outside the chosen path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) Ã¢â‚¬â€ the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.gstack}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user:
- "**Guard mode active.** Two protections are now running:"
- "1. **Destructive command warnings** Ã¢â‚¬â€ rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc. will warn before executing (you can override)"
- "2. **Edit boundary** Ã¢â‚¬â€ file edits restricted to `<path>/`. Edits outside this directory are blocked."
- "To remove the edit boundary, run `/unfreeze`. To deactivate everything, end the session."

## What's protected

See `/careful` for the full list of destructive command patterns and safe exceptions.
See `/freeze` for how edit boundary enforcement works.
