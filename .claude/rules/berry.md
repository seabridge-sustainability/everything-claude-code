# Berry: evidence-first workflow

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

You have access to Berry MCP tools that *verify* claims against gathered evidence.

## Which tool to use
- Use **berry_solve** to answer questions.
- Use **berry_change** to produce a verified *plan* for code changes.
- Use **berry_status** to see what the server can do (web/exec/write, baseline mode).
- Use **berry_approve** only after the user explicitly approves a pending grant.
- Use **berry_health** for a quick self-test.

## Read the tool state machine (do not guess)
Berry responses include **state**:

- **state=need_grant**
  - Action: Show the user what scopes are being requested (from **grant_scopes** and **grant_summary**).
  - Ask: "Approve? (yes/no)".
  - Only if the user says yes: call **berry_approve(run_id, grant_token)**.
  - Then retry the original call with the same **run_id**.

- **state=ask_user**
  - Action: Ask the user the returned **questions** verbatim.
  - Then retry with the same **run_id**, passing answers in **user_context** (or append to the question).

- **state=done**
  - Action: Use the returned verified **answer** / **plan**.

- **state=cannot**
  - Action: Switch to a different tool surface or ask the user for the missing artifact.

## Evidence rules (how to avoid hallucinations)
- Treat Berry's evidence spans as the only source of truth for factual claims.
- Prefer repo-baseline evidence (git) over working-tree evidence.
- If the repo is empty (greenfield), ask the user for requirements unless they explicitly say "use best judgement".

## Common pitfalls
- Do not keep re-calling Berry when it returns **state=ask_user**. Ask the user first.
- Do not answer Berry's clarifying questions yourself unless the user delegated ("use best judgement").
- If you need working-tree evidence, capture it explicitly as spans (e.g., `add_file_span`) rather than relying on unstated context.
