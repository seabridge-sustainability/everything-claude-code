# PHP Coding Style

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## Standards

- Follow **PSR-12** formatting and naming conventions.
- Prefer `declare(strict_types=1);` in application code.
- Use scalar type hints, return types, and typed properties everywhere new code permits.

## Immutability

- Prefer immutable DTOs and value objects for data crossing service boundaries.
- Use `readonly` properties or immutable constructors for request/response payloads where possible.
- Keep arrays for simple maps; promote business-critical structures into explicit classes.

## Formatting

- Use **PHP-CS-Fixer** or **Laravel Pint** for formatting.
- Use **PHPStan** or **Psalm** for static analysis.
- Keep Composer scripts checked in so the same commands run locally and in CI.

## Imports

- Add `use` statements for all referenced classes, interfaces, and traits.
- Avoid relying on the global namespace unless the project explicitly prefers fully qualified names.

## Error Handling

- Throw exceptions for exceptional states; avoid returning `false`/`null` as hidden error channels in new code.
- Convert framework/request input into validated DTOs before it reaches domain logic.

## Reference

See skill: `backend-patterns` for broader service/repository layering guidance.
