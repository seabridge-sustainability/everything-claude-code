# PHP Hooks

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **Pint / PHP-CS-Fixer**: Auto-format edited `.php` files.
- **PHPStan / Psalm**: Run static analysis after PHP edits in typed codebases.
- **PHPUnit / Pest**: Run targeted tests for touched files or modules when edits affect behavior.

## Warnings

- Warn on `var_dump`, `dd`, `dump`, or `die()` left in edited files.
- Warn when edited PHP files add raw SQL or disable CSRF/session protections.
