# Agent Orchestration

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

## Available Agents

ECC agents ship with the `ecc@ecc` plugin, not in `~/.claude/agents/`.
They are invoked through the Agent tool with a plugin-scoped `subagent_type`:

```text
Agent(subagent_type: "ecc:planner", prompt: "...")
```

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| ecc:planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| ecc:architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| ecc:tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| ecc:code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| ecc:security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| ecc:build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| ecc:e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| ecc:refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| ecc:doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |
| ecc:rust-reviewer | Rust code review | Rust projects |
| ecc:harmonyos-app-resolver | HarmonyOS app development | HarmonyOS/ArkTS projects |

For the full roster of 68 agents, see `/ecc:ecc-guide`.

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **ecc:planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **ecc:code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **ecc:tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **ecc:architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth module
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utilities

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Delegation Completion Contract

Applies to every agent at every depth (parent, child, grandchild):

1. **Your final message IS the deliverable.** Never end your turn with "waiting for background agents" — a spawned task is not a completed task. Ending your turn while children are running orphans their results (completed children cannot notify a parent whose turn has ended).
2. **If you delegate, you own collection.** Wait for results, integrate them, then return. Fire-and-forget delegation is forbidden.
3. **Decompose only when the work cannot fit in one context.** Do not re-delegate a task already sized for a single agent — depth is an outcome, not a plan.

> Rationale: observed failure mode — research agents followed "Parallel Task Execution" above, spawned children, and returned "waiting" as their final answer. All children completed successfully but their results were orphaned. The parallel rule without a completion contract produces zombie tasks.

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
