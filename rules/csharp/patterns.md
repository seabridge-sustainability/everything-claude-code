<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

## API Response Pattern

```csharp
public sealed record ApiResponse<T>(
    bool Success,
    T? Data = default,
    string? Error = null,
    object? Meta = null);
```

## Repository Pattern

```csharp
public interface IRepository<T>
{
    Task<IReadOnlyList<T>> FindAllAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    Task<T?> FindByIdAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    Task<T> CreateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    Task<T> UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
    Task DeleteAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

## Options Pattern

Use strongly typed options for config instead of reading raw strings throughout the codebase.

```csharp
public sealed class PaymentsOptions
{
    public const string SectionName = "Payments";
    public required string BaseUrl { get; init; }
    public required string ApiKeySecretName { get; init; }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

- Depend on interfaces at service boundaries
- Keep constructors focused; if a service needs too many dependencies, split responsibilities
- Register lifetimes intentionally: singleton for stateless/shared services, scoped for request data, transient for lightweight pure workers
