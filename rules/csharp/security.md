# C# Security

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## Secret Management

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or connection strings in source code
- Use environment variables, user secrets for local development, and a secret manager in production
- Keep `appsettings.*.json` free of real credentials

```csharp
// BAD
const string ApiKey = "sk-live-123";

// GOOD
var apiKey = builder.Configuration["OpenAI:ApiKey"]
    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("OpenAI:ApiKey is not configured.");
```

## SQL Injection Prevention

- Always use parameterized queries with ADO.NET, Dapper, or EF Core
- Never concatenate user input into SQL strings
- Validate sort fields and filter operators before using dynamic query composition

```csharp
const string sql = "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerId = @customerId";
await connection.QueryAsync<Order>(sql, new { customerId });
```

## Input Validation

- Validate DTOs at the application boundary
- Use data annotations, FluentValidation, or explicit guard clauses
- Reject invalid model state before running business logic

## Authentication and Authorization

- Prefer framework auth handlers instead of custom token parsing
- Enforce authorization policies at endpoint or handler boundaries
- Never log raw tokens, passwords, or PII

## Error Handling

- Return safe client-facing messages
- Log detailed exceptions with structured context server-side
- Do not expose stack traces, SQL text, or filesystem paths in API responses
