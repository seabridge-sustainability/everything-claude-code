# C++ Testing

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## Framework

Use **GoogleTest** (gtest/gmock) with **CMake/CTest**.

## Running Tests

```bash
cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Coverage

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="--coverage" -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="--coverage" ..
cmake --build .
ctest --output-on-failure
lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
```

## Sanitizers

Always run tests with sanitizers in CI:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined" ..
```

## Reference

See skill: `cpp-testing` for detailed C++ testing patterns, TDD workflow, and GoogleTest/GMock usage.
