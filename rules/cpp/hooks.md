## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.

## Build Hooks

Run these checks before committing C++ changes:

```bash
# Format check
clang-format --dry-run --Werror src/*.cpp src/*.hpp

# Static analysis
clang-tidy src/*.cpp -- -std=c++17

# Build
cmake --build build

# Tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Recommended CI Pipeline

1. **clang-format** Ã¢â‚¬â€ formatting check
2. **clang-tidy** Ã¢â‚¬â€ static analysis
3. **cppcheck** Ã¢â‚¬â€ additional analysis
4. **cmake build** Ã¢â‚¬â€ compilation
5. **ctest** Ã¢â‚¬â€ test execution with sanitizers
