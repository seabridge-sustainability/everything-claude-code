<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

> This file extends [common/coding-style.md](../common/coding-style.md) with C++ specific content.

## Modern C++ (C++17/20/23)

- Prefer **modern C++ features** over C-style constructs
- Use `auto` when the type is obvious from context
- Use `constexpr` for compile-time constants
- Use structured bindings: `auto [key, value] = map_entry;`

## Resource Management

- **RAII everywhere** Ã¢â‚¬â€ no manual `new`/`delete`
- Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership
- Use `std::shared_ptr` only when shared ownership is truly needed
- Use `std::make_unique` / `std::make_shared` over raw `new`

## Naming Conventions

- Types/Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/Methods: `snake_case` or `camelCase` (follow project convention)
- Constants: `kPascalCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Namespaces: `lowercase`
- Member variables: `snake_case_` (trailing underscore) or `m_` prefix

## Formatting

- Use **clang-format** Ã¢â‚¬â€ no style debates
- Run `clang-format -i <file>` before committing

## Reference

See skill: `cpp-coding-standards` for comprehensive C++ coding standards and guidelines.
