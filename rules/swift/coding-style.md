<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

## Formatting

- **SwiftFormat** for auto-formatting, **SwiftLint** for style enforcement
- `swift-format` is bundled with Xcode 16+ as an alternative

## Immutability

- Prefer `let` over `var` Ã¢â‚¬â€ define everything as `let` and only change to `var` if the compiler requires it
- Use `struct` with value semantics by default; use `class` only when identity or reference semantics are needed

## Naming

Follow [Apple API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/):

- Clarity at the point of use Ã¢â‚¬â€ omit needless words
- Name methods and properties for their roles, not their types
- Use `static let` for constants over global constants

## Error Handling

Use typed throws (Swift 6+) and pattern matching:

```swift
func load(id: String) throws(LoadError) -> Item {
    guard let data = try? read(from: path) else {
        throw .fileNotFound(id)
    }
    return try decode(data)
}
```

## Concurrency

Enable Swift 6 strict concurrency checking. Prefer:

- `Sendable` value types for data crossing isolation boundaries
- Actors for shared mutable state
- Structured concurrency (`async let`, `TaskGroup`) over unstructured `Task {}`
