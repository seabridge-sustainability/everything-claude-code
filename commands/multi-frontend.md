# Frontend - Frontend-Focused Development

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Frontend-focused workflow (Research Ã¢â€ â€™ Ideation Ã¢â€ â€™ Plan Ã¢â€ â€™ Execute Ã¢â€ â€™ Optimize Ã¢â€ â€™ Review), Gemini-led.

## Usage

```bash
/frontend <UI task description>
```

## Context

- Frontend task: $ARGUMENTS
- Gemini-led, Codex for auxiliary reference
- Applicable: Component design, responsive layout, UI animations, style optimization

## Your Role

You are the **Frontend Orchestrator**, coordinating multi-model collaboration for UI/UX tasks (Research Ã¢â€ â€™ Ideation Ã¢â€ â€™ Plan Ã¢â€ â€™ Execute Ã¢â€ â€™ Optimize Ã¢â€ â€™ Review).

**Collaborative Models**:
- **Gemini** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frontend UI/UX (**Frontend authority, trustworthy**)
- **Codex** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Backend perspective (**Frontend opinions for reference only**)
- **Claude (self)** Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Orchestration, planning, execution, delivery

## Multi-Model Call Specification

**Call Syntax**:

```
# New session call
Bash({
  command: "~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper {{LITE_MODE_FLAG}}--backend gemini --gemini-model gemini-3-pro-preview - \"$PWD\" <<'EOF'
ROLE_FILE: <role prompt path>
<TASK>
Requirement: <enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)>
Context: <project context and analysis from previous phases>
</TASK>
OUTPUT: Expected output format
EOF",
  run_in_background: false,
  timeout: 3600000,
  description: "Brief description"
})

# Resume session call
Bash({
  command: "~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper {{LITE_MODE_FLAG}}--backend gemini --gemini-model gemini-3-pro-preview resume <SESSION_ID> - \"$PWD\" <<'EOF'
ROLE_FILE: <role prompt path>
<TASK>
Requirement: <enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)>
Context: <project context and analysis from previous phases>
</TASK>
OUTPUT: Expected output format
EOF",
  run_in_background: false,
  timeout: 3600000,
  description: "Brief description"
})
```

**Role Prompts**:

| Phase | Gemini |
|-------|--------|
| Analysis | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/analyzer.md` |
| Planning | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/architect.md` |
| Review | `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/reviewer.md` |

**Session Reuse**: Each call returns `SESSION_ID: xxx`, use `resume xxx` for subsequent phases. Save `GEMINI_SESSION` in Phase 2, use `resume` in Phases 3 and 5.

---

## Communication Guidelines

1. Start responses with mode label `[Mode: X]`, initial is `[Mode: Research]`
2. Follow strict sequence: `Research Ã¢â€ â€™ Ideation Ã¢â€ â€™ Plan Ã¢â€ â€™ Execute Ã¢â€ â€™ Optimize Ã¢â€ â€™ Review`
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for user interaction when needed (e.g., confirmation/selection/approval)

---

## Core Workflow

### Phase 0: Prompt Enhancement (Optional)

`[Mode: Prepare]` - If ace-tool MCP available, call `mcp__ace-tool__enhance_prompt`, **replace original $ARGUMENTS with enhanced result for subsequent Gemini calls**. If unavailable, use `$ARGUMENTS` as-is.

### Phase 1: Research

`[Mode: Research]` - Understand requirements and gather context

1. **Code Retrieval** (if ace-tool MCP available): Call `mcp__ace-tool__search_context` to retrieve existing components, styles, design system. If unavailable, use built-in tools: `Glob` for file discovery, `Grep` for component/style search, `Read` for context gathering, `Task` (Explore agent) for deeper exploration.
2. Requirement completeness score (0-10): >=7 continue, <7 stop and supplement

### Phase 2: Ideation

`[Mode: Ideation]` - Gemini-led analysis

**MUST call Gemini** (follow call specification above):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/analyzer.md`
- Requirement: Enhanced requirement (or $ARGUMENTS if not enhanced)
- Context: Project context from Phase 1
- OUTPUT: UI feasibility analysis, recommended solutions (at least 2), UX evaluation

**Save SESSION_ID** (`GEMINI_SESSION`) for subsequent phase reuse.

Output solutions (at least 2), wait for user selection.

### Phase 3: Planning

`[Mode: Plan]` - Gemini-led planning

**MUST call Gemini** (use `resume <GEMINI_SESSION>` to reuse session):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/architect.md`
- Requirement: User's selected solution
- Context: Analysis results from Phase 2
- OUTPUT: Component structure, UI flow, styling approach

Claude synthesizes plan, save to `.claude/plan/task-name.md` after user approval.

### Phase 4: Implementation

`[Mode: Execute]` - Code development

- Strictly follow approved plan
- Follow existing project design system and code standards
- Ensure responsiveness, accessibility

### Phase 5: Optimization

`[Mode: Optimize]` - Gemini-led review

**MUST call Gemini** (follow call specification above):
- ROLE_FILE: `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/gemini/reviewer.md`
- Requirement: Review the following frontend code changes
- Context: git diff or code content
- OUTPUT: Accessibility, responsiveness, performance, design consistency issues list

Integrate review feedback, execute optimization after user confirmation.

### Phase 6: Quality Review

`[Mode: Review]` - Final evaluation

- Check completion against plan
- Verify responsiveness and accessibility
- Report issues and recommendations

## Key Rules

1. **Gemini frontend opinions are trustworthy**
2. **Codex frontend opinions for reference only**
3. External models have **zero filesystem write access**
4. Claude handles all code writes and file operations
