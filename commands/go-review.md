# Go Code Review

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

This command invokes the **go-reviewer** agent for comprehensive Go-specific code review.

## What This Command Does

1. **Identify Go Changes**: Find modified `.go` files via `git diff`
2. **Run Static Analysis**: Execute `go vet`, `staticcheck`, and `golangci-lint`
3. **Security Scan**: Check for SQL injection, command injection, race conditions
4. **Concurrency Review**: Analyze goroutine safety, channel usage, mutex patterns
5. **Idiomatic Go Check**: Verify code follows Go conventions and best practices
6. **Generate Report**: Categorize issues by severity

## When to Use

Use `/go-review` when:
- After writing or modifying Go code
- Before committing Go changes
- Reviewing pull requests with Go code
- Onboarding to a new Go codebase
- Learning idiomatic Go patterns

## Review Categories

### CRITICAL (Must Fix)
- SQL/Command injection vulnerabilities
- Race conditions without synchronization
- Goroutine leaks
- Hardcoded credentials
- Unsafe pointer usage
- Ignored errors in critical paths

### HIGH (Should Fix)
- Missing error wrapping with context
- Panic instead of error returns
- Context not propagated
- Unbuffered channels causing deadlocks
- Interface not satisfied errors
- Missing mutex protection

### MEDIUM (Consider)
- Non-idiomatic code patterns
- Missing godoc comments on exports
- Inefficient string concatenation
- Slice not preallocated
- Table-driven tests not used

## Automated Checks Run

```bash
# Static analysis
go vet ./...

# Advanced checks (if installed)
staticcheck ./...
golangci-lint run

# Race detection
go build -race ./...

# Security vulnerabilities
govulncheck ./...
```

## Example Usage

```text
User: /go-review

Agent:
# Go Code Review Report

## Files Reviewed
- internal/handler/user.go (modified)
- internal/service/auth.go (modified)

## Static Analysis Results
✓ go vet: No issues
✓ staticcheck: No issues

## Issues Found

[CRITICAL] Race Condition
File: internal/service/auth.go:45
Issue: Shared map accessed without synchronization
```go
var cache = map[string]*Session{}  // Concurrent access!

func GetSession(id string) *Session {
    return cache[id]  // Race condition
}
```
Fix: Use sync.RWMutex or sync.Map
```go
var (
    cache   = map[string]*Session{}
    cacheMu sync.RWMutex
)

func GetSession(id string) *Session {
    cacheMu.RLock()
    defer cacheMu.RUnlock()
    return cache[id]
}
```

[HIGH] Missing Error Context
File: internal/handler/user.go:28
Issue: Error returned without context
```go
return err  // No context
```
Fix: Wrap with context
```go
return fmt.Errorf("get user %s: %w", userID, err)
```

## Summary
- CRITICAL: 1
- HIGH: 1
- MEDIUM: 0

Recommendation: FAIL: Block merge until CRITICAL issue is fixed
```

## Approval Criteria

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| PASS: Approve | No CRITICAL or HIGH issues |
| WARNING: Warning | Only MEDIUM issues (merge with caution) |
| FAIL: Block | CRITICAL or HIGH issues found |

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use `/go-test` first to ensure tests pass
- Use `/go-build` if build errors occur
- Use `/go-review` before committing
- Use `/code-review` for non-Go specific concerns

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.

Canonical protocol: `C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\protocols\GOAL_PROTOCOL.md`
