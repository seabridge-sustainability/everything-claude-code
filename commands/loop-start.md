# Loop Start Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Start a managed autonomous loop pattern with safety defaults.

## Usage

`/loop-start [pattern] [--mode safe|fast]`

- `pattern`: `sequential`, `continuous-pr`, `rfc-dag`, `infinite`
- `--mode`:
  - `safe` (default): strict quality gates and checkpoints
  - `fast`: reduced gates for speed

## Token Availability Retry

When the user explicitly asks an agent to continue once tokens are available,
use the opt-in retry wrapper instead of a blind infinite loop:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\scripts\agent-token-retry.ps1 `
  -Name "seabridge-continue" `
  -IntervalHours 4 `
  -MaxHours 72 `
  -Command 'claude -p "Continue the previous task. First read CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and the latest session notes, then proceed from the last safe checkpoint."'
```

Defaults:
- retry every 4 hours
- stop after 72 hours or 18 attempts
- retry only token/rate/quota/capacity failures
- stop on normal code/test failures unless `-RetryAll` is passed
- write logs and latest state to `.ecc/loops/`

Use this only after the user explicitly requests autonomous retry behavior.
Do not use it for destructive, paid, or deployment actions unless those actions
were separately approved.

## Flow

1. Confirm repository state and branch strategy.
2. Select loop pattern and model tier strategy.
3. Enable required hooks/profile for the chosen mode.
4. Create loop plan and write runbook under `.claude/plans/`.
5. Print commands to start and monitor the loop.

## Required Safety Checks

- Verify tests pass before first loop iteration.
- Ensure `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` is not disabled globally.
- Ensure loop has explicit stop condition.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS:
- `<pattern>` optional (`sequential|continuous-pr|rfc-dag|infinite`)
- `--mode safe|fast` optional

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.

Canonical protocol: `C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\protocols\GOAL_PROTOCOL.md`
