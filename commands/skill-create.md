<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Analyze your repository's git history to extract coding patterns and generate SKILL.md files that teach Claude your team's practices.

## Usage

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --commits 100      # Analyze last 100 commits
/skill-create --output ./skills  # Custom output directory
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning-v2
```

## What It Does

1. **Parses Git History** - Analyzes commits, file changes, and patterns
2. **Detects Patterns** - Identifies recurring workflows and conventions
3. **Generates SKILL.md** - Creates valid Claude Code skill files
4. **Optionally Creates Instincts** - For the continuous-learning-v2 system

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Gather Git Data

```bash
# Get recent commits with file changes
git log --oneline -n ${COMMITS:-200} --name-only --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%ad" --date=short

# Get commit frequency by file
git log --oneline -n 200 --name-only | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "^[a-f0-9]" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Get commit message patterns
git log --oneline -n 200 | cut -d' ' -f2- | head -50
```

### Step 2: Detect Patterns

Look for these pattern types:

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Commit conventions** | Regex on commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:) |
| **File co-changes** | Files that always change together |
| **Workflow sequences** | Repeated file change patterns |
| **Architecture** | Folder structure and naming conventions |
| **Testing patterns** | Test file locations, naming, coverage |

### Step 3: Generate SKILL.md

Output format:

```markdown
---
name: {repo-name}-patterns
description: Coding patterns extracted from {repo-name}
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: {count}
---

# {Repo Name} Patterns

## Commit Conventions
{detected commit message patterns}

## Code Architecture
{detected folder structure and organization}

## Workflows
{detected repeating file change patterns}

## Testing Patterns
{detected test conventions}
```

### Step 4: Generate Instincts (if --instincts)

For continuous-learning-v2 integration:

```yaml
---
id: {repo}-commit-convention
trigger: "when writing a commit message"
confidence: 0.8
domain: git
source: local-repo-analysis
---

# Use Conventional Commits

## Action
Prefix commits with: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, test:, refactor:

## Evidence
- Analyzed {n} commits
- {percentage}% follow conventional commit format
```

## Example Output

Running `/skill-create` on a TypeScript project might produce:

```markdown
---
name: my-app-patterns
description: Coding patterns from my-app repository
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: 150
---

# My App Patterns

## Commit Conventions

This project uses **conventional commits**:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation updates

## Code Architecture

```
src/
├── components/     # React components (PascalCase.tsx)
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (use*.ts)
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── services/       # API and external services
```

## Workflows

### Adding a New Component
1. Create `src/components/ComponentName.tsx`
2. Add tests in `src/components/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
3. Export from `src/components/index.ts`

### Database Migration
1. Modify `src/db/schema.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:generate`
3. Run `pnpm db:migrate`

## Testing Patterns

- Test files: `__tests__/` directories or `.test.ts` suffix
- Coverage target: 80%+
- Framework: Vitest
```

## GitHub App Integration

For advanced features (10k+ commits, team sharing, auto-PRs), use the [Skill Creator GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator):

- Install: [github.com/apps/skill-creator](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator)
- Comment `/skill-creator analyze` on any issue
- Receives PR with generated skills

## Related Commands

- `/instinct-import` - Import generated instincts
- `/instinct-status` - View learned instincts
- `/evolve` - Cluster instincts into skills/agents
