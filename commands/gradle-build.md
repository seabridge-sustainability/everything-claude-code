# Gradle Build Fix

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Incrementally fix Gradle build and compilation errors for Android and Kotlin Multiplatform projects.

## Step 1: Detect Build Configuration

Identify the project type and run the appropriate build:

| Indicator | Build Command |
|-----------|---------------|
| `build.gradle.kts` + `composeApp/` (KMP) | `./gradlew composeApp:compileKotlinMetadata 2>&1` |
| `build.gradle.kts` + `app/` (Android) | `./gradlew app:compileDebugKotlin 2>&1` |
| `settings.gradle.kts` with modules | `./gradlew assemble 2>&1` |
| Detekt configured | `./gradlew detekt 2>&1` |

Also check `gradle.properties` and `local.properties` for configuration.

## Step 2: Parse and Group Errors

1. Run the build command and capture output
2. Separate Kotlin compilation errors from Gradle configuration errors
3. Group by module and file path
4. Sort: configuration errors first, then compilation errors by dependency order

## Step 3: Fix Loop

For each error:

1. **Read the file** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Full context around the error line
2. **Diagnose** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Common categories:
   - Missing import or unresolved reference
   - Type mismatch or incompatible types
   - Missing dependency in `build.gradle.kts`
   - Expect/actual mismatch (KMP)
   - Compose compiler error
3. **Fix minimally** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Smallest change that resolves the error
4. **Re-run build** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Verify fix and check for new errors
5. **Continue** Ã¢â‚¬â€ Move to next error

## Step 4: Guardrails

Stop and ask the user if:
- Fix introduces more errors than it resolves
- Same error persists after 3 attempts
- Error requires adding new dependencies or changing module structure
- Gradle sync itself fails (configuration-phase error)
- Error is in generated code (Room, SQLDelight, KSP)

## Step 5: Summary

Report:
- Errors fixed (module, file, description)
- Errors remaining
- New errors introduced (should be zero)
- Suggested next steps

## Common Gradle/KMP Fixes

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Unresolved reference in `commonMain` | Check if the dependency is in `commonMain.dependencies {}` |
| Expect declaration without actual | Add `actual` implementation in each platform source set |
| Compose compiler version mismatch | Align Kotlin and Compose compiler versions in `libs.versions.toml` |
| Duplicate class | Check for conflicting dependencies with `./gradlew dependencies` |
| KSP error | Run `./gradlew kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata` to regenerate |
| Configuration cache issue | Check for non-serializable task inputs |
