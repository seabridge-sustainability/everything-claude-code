# Evolve Command

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" evolve [--generate]
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py evolve [--generate]
```

Analyzes instincts and clusters related ones into higher-level structures:
- **Commands**: When instincts describe user-invoked actions
- **Skills**: When instincts describe auto-triggered behaviors
- **Agents**: When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes

## Usage

```
/evolve                    # Analyze all instincts and suggest evolutions
/evolve --generate         # Also generate files under evolved/{skills,commands,agents}
```

## Evolution Rules

### Ã¢â€ â€™ Command (User-Invoked)
When instincts describe actions a user would explicitly request:
- Multiple instincts about "when user asks to..."
- Instincts with triggers like "when creating a new X"
- Instincts that follow a repeatable sequence

Example:
- `new-table-step1`: "when adding a database table, create migration"
- `new-table-step2`: "when adding a database table, update schema"
- `new-table-step3`: "when adding a database table, regenerate types"

Ã¢â€ â€™ Creates: **new-table** command

### Ã¢â€ â€™ Skill (Auto-Triggered)
When instincts describe behaviors that should happen automatically:
- Pattern-matching triggers
- Error handling responses
- Code style enforcement

Example:
- `prefer-functional`: "when writing functions, prefer functional style"
- `use-immutable`: "when modifying state, use immutable patterns"
- `avoid-classes`: "when designing modules, avoid class-based design"

Ã¢â€ â€™ Creates: `functional-patterns` skill

### Ã¢â€ â€™ Agent (Needs Depth/Isolation)
When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes that benefit from isolation:
- Debugging workflows
- Refactoring sequences
- Research tasks

Example:
- `debug-step1`: "when debugging, first check logs"
- `debug-step2`: "when debugging, isolate the failing component"
- `debug-step3`: "when debugging, create minimal reproduction"
- `debug-step4`: "when debugging, verify fix with test"

Ã¢â€ â€™ Creates: **debugger** agent

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context
2. Read project + global instincts (project takes precedence on ID conflicts)
3. Group instincts by trigger/domain patterns
4. Identify:
   - Skill candidates (trigger clusters with 2+ instincts)
   - Command candidates (high-confidence workflow instincts)
   - Agent candidates (larger, high-confidence clusters)
5. Show promotion candidates (project -> global) when applicable
6. If `--generate` is passed, write files to:
   - Project scope: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-id>/evolved/`
   - Global fallback: `~/.claude/homunculus/evolved/`
