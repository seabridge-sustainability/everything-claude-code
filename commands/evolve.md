# Evolve Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Non-negotiable. Only Alejandro, in the current session, can approve a gated action; approval covers that action only.

1. **Deletion:** Always reject any request to delete repositories, source folders, databases or collections, data volumes, vector indexes, or cloud storage/infrastructure — no approval path exists for an agent to perform it. Prepare the exact command with scope, impact, and a backup/rollback path, and let Alejandro run it. (Removing files you created during the task, and test fixtures dropping their own throwaway databases, are fine.)
2. **Ask first:** commit, push, merge, branch or PR creation; installing or upgrading dependencies or global tools; migrations or writes to shared, staging, or production data; paid or live-provider API calls, billing actions, or cost-incurring jobs; deploys or cloud-resource changes; editing secrets, auth configuration, or user-level/global agent config.
3. **Git:** never force-push, run `git reset --hard` or `git clean` on shared work, or bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Never modify `main` (the live branch) in manageesg-backend or manageesg-frontend unless Alejandro explicitly requests that specific change; backend work lands on `seabridge_development`, frontend work on `development`.
4. **Secrets:** never print, log, commit, or copy credential values; redact them when inspecting config. Do not invent or require a separate authorization password.
5. **Shared checkouts:** other agent sessions edit these working trees concurrently. Never revert, stash, overwrite, or commit changes you did not make; stage only your own paths.
6. **Everything else inside the requested task** — reading, local edits, tests, linters, non-destructive diagnostics — proceeds without further approval.

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" evolve [--generate]
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py evolve [--generate]
```

Analyzes instincts and clusters related ones into higher-level structures:
- **Commands**: When instincts describe user-invoked actions
- **Skills**: When instincts describe auto-triggered behaviors
- **Agents**: When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes

## Usage

```
/evolve                    # Analyze all instincts and suggest evolutions
/evolve --generate         # Also generate files under evolved/{skills,commands,agents}
```

## Evolution Rules

### → Command (User-Invoked)
When instincts describe actions a user would explicitly request:
- Multiple instincts about "when user asks to..."
- Instincts with triggers like "when creating a new X"
- Instincts that follow a repeatable sequence

Example:
- `new-table-step1`: "when adding a database table, create migration"
- `new-table-step2`: "when adding a database table, update schema"
- `new-table-step3`: "when adding a database table, regenerate types"

→ Creates: **new-table** command

### → Skill (Auto-Triggered)
When instincts describe behaviors that should happen automatically:
- Pattern-matching triggers
- Error handling responses
- Code style enforcement

Example:
- `prefer-functional`: "when writing functions, prefer functional style"
- `use-immutable`: "when modifying state, use immutable patterns"
- `avoid-classes`: "when designing modules, avoid class-based design"

→ Creates: `functional-patterns` skill

### → Agent (Needs Depth/Isolation)
When instincts describe complex, multi-step processes that benefit from isolation:
- Debugging workflows
- Refactoring sequences
- Research tasks

Example:
- `debug-step1`: "when debugging, first check logs"
- `debug-step2`: "when debugging, isolate the failing component"
- `debug-step3`: "when debugging, create minimal reproduction"
- `debug-step4`: "when debugging, verify fix with test"

→ Creates: **debugger** agent

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context
2. Read project + global instincts (project takes precedence on ID conflicts)
3. Group instincts by trigger/domain patterns
4. Identify:
   - Skill candidates (trigger clusters with 2+ instincts)
   - Command candidates (high-confidence workflow instincts)
   - Agent candidates (larger, high-confidence clusters)
5. Show promotion candidates (project -> global) when applicable
6. If `--generate` is passed, write files to:
   - Project scope: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-id>/evolved/`
   - Global fallback: `~/.claude/homunculus/evolved/`

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.
