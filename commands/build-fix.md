# Build and Fix

## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

1. Session authorization gate: at session start, request authorization through the team-approved secure channel before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Use the team-shared authorization password from your secure internal channel when approval is required; never store that password in code, docs, logs, or commits.


Incrementally fix build and type errors with minimal, safe changes.

## Step 1: Detect Build System

Identify the project's build tool and run the build:

| Indicator | Build Command |
|-----------|---------------|
| `package.json` with `build` script | `npm run build` or `pnpm build` |
| `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript only) | `npx tsc --noEmit` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build 2>&1` |
| `pom.xml` | `mvn compile` |
| `build.gradle` | `./gradlew compileJava` |
| `go.mod` | `go build ./...` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `python -m compileall -q .` or `mypy .` |

## Step 2: Parse and Group Errors

1. Run the build command and capture stderr
2. Group errors by file path
3. Sort by dependency order (fix imports/types before logic errors)
4. Count total errors for progress tracking

## Step 3: Fix Loop (One Error at a Time)

For each error:

1. **Read the file** ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Use Read tool to see error context (10 lines around the error)
2. **Diagnose** ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Identify root cause (missing import, wrong type, syntax error)
3. **Fix minimally** ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Use Edit tool for the smallest change that resolves the error
4. **Re-run build** ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Verify the error is gone and no new errors introduced
5. **Move to next** ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Continue with remaining errors

## Step 4: Guardrails

Stop and ask the user if:
- A fix introduces **more errors than it resolves**
- The **same error persists after 3 attempts** (likely a deeper issue)
- The fix requires **architectural changes** (not just a build fix)
- Build errors stem from **missing dependencies** (need `npm install`, `cargo add`, etc.)

## Step 5: Summary

Show results:
- Errors fixed (with file paths)
- Errors remaining (if any)
- New errors introduced (should be zero)
- Suggested next steps for unresolved issues

## Recovery Strategies

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Missing module/import | Check if package is installed; suggest install command |
| Type mismatch | Read both type definitions; fix the narrower type |
| Circular dependency | Identify cycle with import graph; suggest extraction |
| Version conflict | Check `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` for version constraints |
| Build tool misconfiguration | Read config file; compare with working defaults |

Fix one error at a time for safety. Prefer minimal diffs over refactoring.

## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.
