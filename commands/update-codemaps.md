# Update Codemaps

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Analyze the codebase structure and generate token-lean architecture documentation.

## Step 1: Scan Project Structure

1. Identify the project type (monorepo, single app, library, microservice)
2. Find all source directories (src/, lib/, app/, packages/)
3. Map entry points (main.ts, index.ts, app.py, main.go, etc.)

## Step 2: Generate Codemaps

Create or update codemaps in `docs/CODEMAPS/` (or `.reports/codemaps/`):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `architecture.md` | High-level system diagram, service boundaries, data flow |
| `backend.md` | API routes, middleware chain, service → repository mapping |
| `frontend.md` | Page tree, component hierarchy, state management flow |
| `data.md` | Database tables, relationships, migration history |
| `dependencies.md` | External services, third-party integrations, shared libraries |

### Codemap Format

Each codemap should be token-lean — optimized for AI context consumption:

```markdown
# Backend Architecture

## Routes
POST /api/users → UserController.create → UserService.create → UserRepo.insert
GET  /api/users/:id → UserController.get → UserService.findById → UserRepo.findById

## Key Files
src/services/user.ts (business logic, 120 lines)
src/repos/user.ts (database access, 80 lines)

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL (primary data store)
- Redis (session cache, rate limiting)
- Stripe (payment processing)
```

## Step 3: Diff Detection

1. If previous codemaps exist, calculate the diff percentage
2. If changes > 30%, show the diff and request user approval before overwriting
3. If changes <= 30%, update in place

## Step 4: Add Metadata

Add a freshness header to each codemap:

```markdown
<!-- Generated: 2026-02-11 | Files scanned: 142 | Token estimate: ~800 -->
```

## Step 5: Save Analysis Report

Write a summary to `.reports/codemap-diff.txt`:
- Files added/removed/modified since last scan
- New dependencies detected
- Architecture changes (new routes, new services, etc.)
- Staleness warnings for docs not updated in 90+ days

## Tips

- Focus on **high-level structure**, not implementation details
- Prefer **file paths and function signatures** over full code blocks
- Keep each codemap under **1000 tokens** for efficient context loading
- Use ASCII diagrams for data flow instead of verbose descriptions
- Run after major feature additions or refactoring sessions

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.

Canonical protocol: `C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\protocols\GOAL_PROTOCOL.md`
