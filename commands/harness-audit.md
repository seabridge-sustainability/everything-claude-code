# Harness Audit Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Run a deterministic repository harness audit and return a prioritized scorecard.

## Usage

`/harness-audit [scope] [--format text|json] [--root path]`

- `scope` (optional): `repo` (default), `hooks`, `skills`, `commands`, `agents`
- `--format`: output style (`text` default, `json` for automation)
- `--root`: audit a specific path instead of the current working directory

## Deterministic Engine

Always run:

```bash
node scripts/harness-audit.js <scope> --format <text|json> [--root <path>]
```

This script is the source of truth for scoring and checks. Do not invent additional dimensions or ad-hoc points.

Rubric version: `2026-05-19`.

The script computes up to 12 fixed categories (`0-10` normalized each). The first seven are always applicable; GitHub Integration is always applicable; deploy-target categories are applicable only when a matching marker is detected.

1. Tool Coverage
2. Context Efficiency
3. Quality Gates
4. Memory Persistence
5. Eval Coverage
6. Security Guardrails
7. Cost Efficiency
8. GitHub Integration
9. Vercel Integration *(when `vercel.json` or `.vercel/` is present)*
10. Netlify Integration *(when `netlify.toml` or `.netlify/` is present)*
11. Cloudflare Integration *(when `wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc` is present)*
12. Fly Integration *(when `fly.toml` is present)*

Scores are derived from explicit file/rule checks and are reproducible for the same commit.
The script audits the current working directory by default and auto-detects whether the target is the ECC repo itself or a consumer project using ECC.

## Output Contract

Return:

1. `overall_score` out of `max_score`. `max_score` depends on which categories are applicable to the target; never assume a fixed total.
2. `applicable_categories[]` and `category_count` describing which categories contributed.
3. Category scores and concrete findings.
4. Failed checks with exact file paths.
5. Top 3 actions from the deterministic output (`top_actions`).
6. Suggested ECC skills to apply next.

## Checklist

- Use script output directly; do not rescore manually.
- If `--format json` is requested, return the script JSON unchanged.
- If text is requested, summarize failing checks and top actions.
- Include exact file paths from `checks[]` and `top_actions[]`.

## Example Result

```text
Harness Audit (repo, repo): 71/80
- Tool Coverage: 10/10 (10/10 pts)
- Context Efficiency: 9/10 (9/10 pts)
- Quality Gates: 10/10 (10/10 pts)
- GitHub Integration: 2/10 (2/10 pts)

Top 3 Actions:
1) [GitHub Integration] Add at least one workflow under .github/workflows/. (.github/workflows/)
2) [Security Guardrails] Add prompt/tool preflight security guards in hooks/hooks.json. (hooks/hooks.json)
3) [Eval Coverage] Increase automated test coverage across scripts/hooks/lib. (tests/)
```

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS:
- `repo|hooks|skills|commands|agents` (optional scope)
- `--format text|json` (optional output format)

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.

Canonical protocol: `C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\protocols\GOAL_PROTOCOL.md`
