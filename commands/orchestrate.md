# Orchestrate Command

<!-- SEABRIDGE_SAFETY_RULE_START -->
## Safety And Authorization Rule

Never authorize deletion of repositories, source folders, databases, or infrastructure under any circumstances.

> **System-wide policy:** the canonical shared system at `everything-claude-code/AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` (mirrored locally as `AGENTS_SYSTEM.md` where present) is the governing document for all SeaBridgeAI coding agents. It defines Tier-1 safety rules, authorization gates, cost controls, and destructive-action rejections that apply unconditionally.

1. Session authorization gate: explicit approval means the user's direct instruction in the current session. Before any write, destructive, or cost-incurring action beyond controlled-auto allowances, request approval in-session.
2. Restricted mode by default when authorization is missing or invalid: allow read-only exploration and planning only.
3. Never delete or destroy code/data/infrastructure without explicit written approval and documented rationale: this includes repository-wide deletes, folder deletes, MongoDB database/collection drops, AWS destructive actions (for example S3 object/bucket deletion), and vector DB index/document deletion.
4. Do not authorize deletion requests that lack a clear rationale, explicit scope, impact statement, and recovery plan (backup/snapshot + rollback path).
5. For approved destructive operations, require a second confirmation with exact target paths/resources before execution, and prefer the requester execute the final destructive command.
6. Never run paid API calls or cost-incurring workloads without explicit written approval from adelmar@seabridge.ai.
7. Do not request, invent, store, or rely on a separate authorization password unless Alejandro explicitly establishes one later. Never store secrets in code, docs, logs, or commits.

Sequential agent workflow for complex tasks.

## Usage

`/orchestrate [workflow-type] [task-description]`

## Workflow Types

### feature
Full feature implementation workflow:
```
planner -> tdd-guide -> code-reviewer -> security-reviewer
```

### bugfix
Bug investigation and fix workflow:
```
planner -> tdd-guide -> code-reviewer
```

### refactor
Safe refactoring workflow:
```
architect -> code-reviewer -> tdd-guide
```

### security
Security-focused review:
```
security-reviewer -> code-reviewer -> architect
```

## Execution Pattern

For each agent in the workflow:

1. **Invoke agent** with context from previous agent
2. **Collect output** as structured handoff document
3. **Pass to next agent** in chain
4. **Aggregate results** into final report

## Handoff Document Format

Between agents, create handoff document:

```markdown
## HANDOFF: [previous-agent] -> [next-agent]

### Context
[Summary of what was done]

### Findings
[Key discoveries or decisions]

### Files Modified
[List of files touched]

### Open Questions
[Unresolved items for next agent]

### Recommendations
[Suggested next steps]
```

## Example: Feature Workflow

```
/orchestrate feature "Add user authentication"
```

Executes:

1. **Planner Agent**
   - Analyzes requirements
   - Creates implementation plan
   - Identifies dependencies
   - Output: `HANDOFF: planner -> tdd-guide`

2. **TDD Guide Agent**
   - Reads planner handoff
   - Writes tests first
   - Implements to pass tests
   - Output: `HANDOFF: tdd-guide -> code-reviewer`

3. **Code Reviewer Agent**
   - Reviews implementation
   - Checks for issues
   - Suggests improvements
   - Output: `HANDOFF: code-reviewer -> security-reviewer`

4. **Security Reviewer Agent**
   - Security audit
   - Vulnerability check
   - Final approval
   - Output: Final Report

## Final Report Format

```
ORCHESTRATION REPORT

[One paragraph summary]

[Test pass/fail summary]

SECURITY STATUS

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
[SHIP / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED]
```

## Parallel Execution

For independent checks, run agents in parallel:

```markdown
### Parallel Phase
Run simultaneously:
- code-reviewer (quality)
- security-reviewer (security)
- architect (design)

### Merge Results
Combine outputs into single report
```

For external tmux-pane workers with separate git worktrees, use `node scripts/orchestrate-worktrees.js plan.json --execute`. The built-in orchestration pattern stays in-process; the helper is for long-running or cross-harness sessions.

When workers need to see dirty or untracked local files from the main checkout, add `seedPaths` to the plan file. ECC overlays only those selected paths into each worker worktree after `git worktree add`, which keeps the branch isolated while still exposing in-flight local scripts, plans, or docs.

```json
{
  "sessionName": "workflow-e2e",
  "seedPaths": [
    "scripts/orchestrate-worktrees.js",
    "scripts/lib/tmux-worktree-orchestrator.js",
    ".claude/plan/workflow-e2e-test.json"
  ],
  "workers": [
    { "name": "docs", "task": "Update orchestration docs." }
  ]
}
```

To export a control-plane snapshot for a live tmux/worktree session, run:

```bash
node scripts/orchestration-status.js .claude/plan/workflow-visual-proof.json
```

The snapshot includes session activity, tmux pane metadata, worker states, objectives, seeded overlays, and recent handoff summaries in JSON form.

## Operator Command-Center Handoff

When the workflow spans multiple sessions, worktrees, or tmux panes, append a control-plane block to the final handoff:

```markdown
CONTROL PLANE
-------------
Sessions:
- active session ID or alias
- branch + worktree path for each active worker
- tmux pane or detached session name when applicable

Diffs:
- git status summary
- git diff --stat for touched files
- merge/conflict risk notes

Approvals:
- pending user approvals
- blocked steps awaiting confirmation

Telemetry:
- last activity timestamp or idle signal
- estimated token or cost drift
- policy events raised by hooks or reviewers
```

This keeps planner, implementer, reviewer, and loop workers legible from the operator surface.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS:
- `feature <description>` - Full feature workflow
- `bugfix <description>` - Bug fix workflow
- `refactor <description>` - Refactoring workflow
- `security <description>` - Security review workflow
- `custom <agents> <description>` - Custom agent sequence

## Custom Workflow Example

```
/orchestrate custom "architect,tdd-guide,code-reviewer" "Redesign caching layer"
```

## Tips

1. **Start with planner** for complex features
2. **Always include code-reviewer** before merge
3. **Use security-reviewer** for auth/payment/PII
4. **Keep handoffs concise** - focus on what next agent needs
5. **Run verification** between agents if needed

<!-- SEABRIDGE_GOAL_COMMAND_INHERITANCE_START -->
## /goal Default Contract

This command inherits the SeaBridgeAI `/goal` protocol. Establish the persistent goal, Definition of Done, validation plan, affected systems, risks, dependencies, artifacts, and blockers before execution. Continue until validation satisfies the DoD or a hard blocker is documented.

Canonical protocol: `C:\Users\adelm\SeaBridgeAI\everything-claude-code\protocols\GOAL_PROTOCOL.md`
